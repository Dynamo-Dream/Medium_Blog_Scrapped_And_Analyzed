My interview appeared condensed and edited on DrivenData\\u2019s blog and here are my full, unedited answers. Even if you don\\u2019t make it through this article \\u2014 there\\u2019s a reason my responses were condensed\\u2014 I\\u2019d recommend checking out DrivenData\\u2019s challenges to get experience with realistic data science problems that try to benefit society. As I try to make clear in this interview, data science is a powerful tool, one that should be put to use in the best interests of our world. What do you do professionally? I\\u2019m currently a full-stack data scientist at Cortex Building Intelligence, a startup that helps office buildings operate more energy-efficiently. Full-stack means I\\u2019m responsible for the whole data science pipeline, taking concepts from idea through to machine learning models providing continuous, real-time operating recommendations. (Here\\u2019s a good article on end-to-end data scientists). The work is very rewarding, in terms of both the day-to-day construction of machine learning systems and the larger mission of reducing carbon dioxide emissions while saving building owners significantly on energy bills. Energy efficiency is a field where the best decision for the environment is also the best for your wallet and where a little data science can go a long way. How did you get started in data science? We tend to look at the past and draw a straight line connecting disparate events, making it seem like the way things turned out was inevitable (the narrative fallacy). It\\u2019s tempting to tell a neat story about how I got into data science, but it really was a random series of unexpected events that led me to this career. In college, I studied mechanical engineering but had two terrible internships that convinced me to change fields. While working one of those internships at NASA, I decided to explore this new field of data science I heard so much about. Since I didn\\u2019t have real responsibilities, I spent almost every hour on the job taking Udacity courses in data science and machine learning. After the internship, I went back for my senior year, and while it was too late to switch my major, I was able to get on a research project using machine learning to help buildings save energy. Little did I realize this project would precisely match a DrivenData challenge and, eventually, my career at Cortex. I spent that year self-studying data science, writing an article a week, and competing in the Power Laws: Forecasting Energy Consumption DrivenData challenge. Coming in third in that competition was a huge confidence boost and convinced me I could make it in this field even without formal university training. After graduation, I was fortunate to be hired at FeatureLabs (since acquired by Alteryx and the maintainers of the featuretools open-source library) as a data scientist on the strength of my blogs and projects. A few months later, I came to work at Cortex where I\\u2019ve been for almost two years. So, the clean story is: a disillusioned mechanical engineer teaches himself data science, works on a data science research project, writes some blog posts, and then goes to work for a startup changing the world with machine learning. The reality was a disconnected bunch of events that ended with me as a data scientist through minimal planning on my part. In hindsight, the one smart thing I did was write publicly about data science projects. The takeaway is you don\\u2019t need university courses to be a data scientist and be prepared to seize the unexpected opportunities that come your way. Data science is a broad field. What areas are you particularly interested in (e.g. computer vision, NLP, geospatial analysis)? Are there particular problems you\\u2019re interested in solving? The applied aspect of data science \\u2014 how can we get machine learning models into production and put the results in front of decision-makers \\u2014 interests me the most. I\\u2019m thankful for researchers who develop the algorithms (the random forest being my goto), but I\\u2019m more concerned about changing real-world outcomes with data science than algorithmic advances. That means I spend a lot of time thinking about infrastructure, including databases, cloud computing, monitoring, and what is generally considered software engineering: testing, deployment, writing high-quality software. At the end of the day, you can use the most cutting-edge algorithms, but if you can\\u2019t get those results to the people who need them when they need them, you can\\u2019t improve real-world systems. There are so many fields with so many problems that need data science \\u2014 healthcare, education, government, transportation, housing \\u2014 but I\\u2019ve chosen to focus on energy, in particular energy efficiency. Climate change is the defining problem of our generation, and data science can help immensely on both the supply (clean energy sources) and demand (reducing energy needs) sides. Admittedly, I\\u2019m somewhat of an idealist, and I firmly believe data science should be used to make the world a better place. It\\u2019s frustrating seeing all the talent and effort devoted to getting people to click on ads, spend more time on social media, or buy more consumer goods. I want to tell my grandkids I was part of the solution, not the problem, and climate change is where I can have the most positive impact. Each of us has a choice to make, and I believe our obligation is not to maximize material gain but to ensure humanity\\u2019s flourishing far into the future. Any good tools, posts, or projects from other developers that you appreciate or think the community might enjoy? There are too many great things in data science to list, but a few of my favorites are: What motivated you to join a DrivenData competition or to continue participating in challenges? The combination of gaining experience solving actual problems with data science and working on a project with socially beneficial objectives initially drew me to DrivenData. The first competition I participated in was Forecasting Energy Demand part of the Power Laws series of challenges. Seeing that I could predict actual energy usage with machine learning was a transformational experience. I saw that what I had read about and studied could be put to use. Working with the toy datasets used in books and college classes gets tedious pretty quick, but DrivenData provided real-world data and the reward of tackling more ambitious problems. That first competition cemented not only my desire to work in the data science field, but also to use machine learning for positive ends. I continue participating in challenges to keep my skills up-to-date. There\\u2019s always something new on the data science scene, and, while I mostly use proven, battle-tested methods in my job, it\\u2019s still fun to see the latest developments and try to put them to practice. It feels like if you\\u2019re not continually learning in data science, you\\u2019re falling behind (The Red Queen\\u2019s Race). The community aspect of challenges is also a large draw \\u2014 many of the competitions are more like collaborations (especially if you\\u2019re not in it for the cash), and it\\u2019s enjoyable to work with others. Combine the prospects of improving my skill set, doing a small part to make the world better, and connecting with others in the field, and DrivenData competitions are a win all-around. Is there a particular DrivenData challenge you\\u2019ve enjoyed working on? The demand forecasting challenge was my favorite. It was the first time I took the material I\\u2019d learned through Udacity courses and books and applied them to actual data. The idea that you could relatively easily build these machine learning models that accurately predicted building energy use was a revelation to me. The problem was straightforward as far as data science problems go: use weather, date, time, and employee occupancy patterns to predict energy use at office buildings. My approach was to combine all the data sources, do a little feature engineering, start off with simple machine learning models, progress to more complex models, and do hyperparameter optimization. I made sure to save some of the data for validation, which helped reduce overfitting, a nearly universal problem in these data science challenges. In hindsight, I probably spent too much time trying to tune the model hyperparameters or use complex models when I should have devoted that time to learning more about the domain and building relevant features. Generally, I\\u2019ve found that the return on time invested is much higher for feature engineering than model tuning. That\\u2019s something I came to learn through the challenge and has shaped my approach to data science problems since. Did you have any domain expertise, or any particular insights from exploring the data, that helped you solve the problem? I wish I had some domain knowledge before working on the competition. At the time, I bought into the idea that data scientists didn\\u2019t need to know about the subject matter and could just let the model learn from the data. It turns out that approach doesn\\u2019t work so great, especially with smaller datasets. Now, I know the value of incorporating domain knowledge into data science through engineered features. What was the most important technical tip or trick you used to solve the problem? Non-technical? Save a validation set or, better yet, use cross-validation to score models. It\\u2019s easy to overfit if you\\u2019re only working with the training set and basing model performance off the public leaderboard. At the end of the competition, I think I was in 5th place on the public leaderboard but ended up in 3rd place on the private leaderboard (and in the money!). The public leader ended up out of the cash, indicating severe overfitting to the public dataset. A lot of these challenges seem to be won with \\u201ctricks\\u201d like ensembling models, but I didn\\u2019t go that far and mostly stuck to relatively basic models but made sure to use all the provided data. This approach may have prevented me from taking first, but, it\\u2019s proven invaluable in my day job where a simple model that we can deploy is much preferable to a complex, ensemble model that proves impossible to productionalize (illustrated by the Netflix Prize competition where the winning model was never used). What advice (career or otherwise) would you give to your younger self? Prioritize mental health. Reach out and get help as soon as you need it. There\\u2019s nothing stigmatizing about mental health issues, and there are effective ways of addressing these very real problems. Besides your internships, no employers will look at your resume, so spend less time worrying about grades and more time enjoying the college experience. Who you know is often more important than what you know, so spend at least as much time forming relationships as studying. You don\\u2019t understand something until you can implement it, so spend less time reading and more time doing. Have a bias towards action. Explaining a topic to others is also a good test of whether you know the concept, and communication is one of the essential skills you\\u2019ll need in any career. Share your results early and often to get feedback and spot issues while they can be quickly addressed. Constructive criticism is invaluable \\u2014 always be asking what you can do better. What hurdles have you had to overcome to become a data scientist? What advice would you give to others facing the same challenges? There aren\\u2019t yet best standards for many aspects of data science, so if you\\u2019re looking for the optimal solution, you\\u2019re probably not going to find a consensus. As a perfectionist, I often struggled because I couldn\\u2019t find the ideal answer. I probably spent too much time reading about methods and not enough time trying them out. Data science is mostly an empirical (as opposed to theoretical) field, which means that if you want to know whether a given method will work, you just have to try it. Being self-taught, I often worried I didn\\u2019t have the credentials to make it as a data scientist. That first DrivenData competition helped boost my confidence, as did writing about my data science projects and seeing the positive feedback (and occasional constructive criticism). I\\u2019d tell others who don\\u2019t have the largely meaningless yet highly-valued pieces of paper known as degrees to do projects with real-world data and make them public (blog posts). Having a body of work to point to can help you get in the door and gives you a chance to demonstrate your skills. Moreover, be ambitious when applying for jobs. My current position asked for 5\\u201310 years of data science experience (as if anyone had that much at the time!); I had three months at another startup and nine months of research. Fortunately, my oeuvre of data science projects spoke volumes, and I was given a chance to prove myself with an assignment. That might not have been possible at a larger company, but still, try reaching out and pointing to your public work. Anything else you want to share with the community? Data science is a powerful tool, and as practitioners, we have a responsibility to use that power for good. DrivenData demonstrates a few of the numerous fields in which data science can make the world a better place. I\\u2019d encourage every individual to think about their values and if their work aligns with those values. I don\\u2019t think about saving the world in my daily work, but when it gets tough, I take solace in the broader picture of what Cortex is doing to address climate change. Working for a company where the mission agrees with my morals is extremely rewarding. Individual choices do matter, and every data scientist that goes to work for a non-profit, government, cleantech startup, or company working to make healthcare more efficient is a win for humanity. Have you read any good books or articles recently? Books are the best tools we have for sharing knowledge so I try to read a good deal across a wide range of subjects. Here are a few books I\\u2019ve recently found worthwhile: What do you enjoy doing outside of work? Outside of work, I like to give back to the community through volunteering. Helping others provides a deep sense of fulfillment and allows you to build lasting friendships with other volunteers. In-person volunteering has been put on hold with the pandemic. Still, there are ways to help out online, like calling to check in on seniors, or working on data science problems with a social benefit on DrivenData! I used to write frequently about data science on Towards Data Science, but that\\u2019s been put on hold while pursuing an online Master\\u2019s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. For stress relief, I go on long runs every day and occasionally compete in ultramarathons (the farthest so far was 100 miles). Challenges \\u2014 whether data science or physical \\u2014 always have appealed to me, and I try to make sure I\\u2019m being tested in at least one dimension. Where do you live? Until March of this year, I lived in New York City, but since then, I\\u2019ve been sheltering back home in the Midwestern US. Cortex has gone fully remote, and, now that I\\u2019m fortunate to be able to work from anywhere with an Internet connection, I\\u2019m trying to be thoughtful about where I live next. NYC is an incredible place, but living there grinds you down, so I\\u2019m looking for a more livable city (recommendations appreciated)! Where can the community find you online (GitHub, Twitter, etc.)? GitHub: https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/ Medium: https://medium.com/@williamkoehrsen Twitter: https://twitter.com/koehrsen_will Since you\\u2019ve made it to the end of this article \\u2014 and maybe even read most of it \\u2014 I can also be reached at wjk68@case.edu (of course I still use my school email for all those discounts). I\\u2019m glad to talk more about my experience and to try and help others with career and personal development. Talking is a lot like writing in that it forces you to formulate vague ideas into understandable, concrete concepts. Often, we think we know an idea, but we don\\u2019t truly comprehend the theory unless we can communicate it clearly in words to someone else. That forced understanding through communication is partly what drove me to write about data science in the first place, and what drove me to speak recently on the Towards Data Science podcast. In the episode, we (me and the host YK from CS Dojo) talk about how I self-taught myself data science, how I earned two data science jobs through my projects, how to make learning data science enjoyable, a top-down approach to learning, and other advice from my journey into the data science field. You can listen to the whole episode (and all other episodes of the TDS podcast) for free on Spotify. Below the episode, I\\u2019ve captured some of the key takeaways. The overall experience of my first podcast was positive, and, as someone who has gained a ton from listening to podcasts, it was fascinating to see a podcast from the interviewee\\u2019s viewpoint. Kudos to all involved at Towards Data Science (for the blog and the podcast) and I look forward to contributing more to building the data science community. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. You can reach out in the responses, or on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Over the past year, I\\u2019ve gone from the simple world of writing Jupyter Notebooks to developing machine learning pipelines that deliver real-time recommendations to building engineers around the clock. While I have room for improvement (I still make plenty of coding and data science mistakes), I\\u2019ve managed to learn a few things about data science that we\\u2019ll go through in this article. Hopefully, with the lessons below, you\\u2019ll avoid many of the errors I made learning to operate on the day-to-day data science frontlines. Author\\u2019s note: This is written from a single perspective, which does not represent the entire field of data science. Keep in mind this is from an end-to-end (concept to deployed machine learning system) data scientist working in the building energy sector, providing real-time recommendations for operating buildings more efficiently. If you\\u2019ve had different experiences or would like to contradict me, the comment section is waiting for your reply. When asked about the hardest part of the job, I firmly reply it\\u2019s not machine learning, considering all our ML looks like: Instead, the hardest parts of data science are developing everything that occurs before and after modeling. Before we have: loading data from a database, feature engineering, data validation, and data processing pipelines (assuming our job starts after data is ingested). After we need to verify the results, set tasks to run automatically on a schedule, write results back to our database and send off webhooks to trigger other services. These peripheral actions, which comprise most of the work in machine learning, all require solid computer science practices. A few of these practices which pertain to developing code are writing many short functions each of which does one thing well, developing classes to implement related functions, proper naming conventions, writing unit tests on the code and data, writing code that is meant to be read, and not repeating code. Also, there are other computer science practices to apply around the code itself, such as version control, code reviews, continuous integration, code coverage, and deployment, which has now spawned an entirely separate field of machine learning operations (MLOps). Although I managed to make the mechanical engineering -> data scientist transition, in retrospect, it would have been more productive to do engineering -> computer science -> data science. The second approach would have meant I didn\\u2019t have to unlearn the poor coding practices I picked up in data science classes. In other words, I think it\\u2019s easier to add data science on top of a solid computer science background than to learn data science first and then take up computer science (but both routes are possible). Computer science involves an entirely different way of systematic thinking, methodically planning before coding, writing code slowly, and testing code once it\\u2019s written. Clean code is in stark contrast to the often free-wheeling nature of data science with dozens of half-written notebooks (we\\u2019ve all had notebooks calledUntitled12.ipynb ) and an emphasis on getting immediate results rather than writing rather error-free code that can be re-used. All data scientists can benefit from a course on computer science best coding practices. The ability to structure scripts and packages, to write clean code, to test and to document code makes the transition from exploratory data science to production machine learning more manageable. Moreover, they instill a model of thinking that leads to re-usable code easy for others to understand. Even academic data scientists, who typically write data science scripts to analyze data for papers would be helped by better practices. Perhaps the reproducibility issues in science would improve if scientists wrote cleaner code and included unit tests to verify inputs, outputs, and function behavior. There are many topics to learn in data science, and it can feel overwhelming at times. However, computer science should not be viewed as an add-on; instead, it should be seen as foundational for data scientists who want to see their code operationalized. Fortunately, there are plenty of resources, such as software carpentry, which anyone can use to learn and apply these practices. Data science promises to make optimal decisions using data instead of human judgment. It\\u2019s a noble cause, but one that is far from current reality because the data and the methods we use to analyze it are subject to human influence to a significant degree. Even the supposedly objective field of data science rests on human behavior. As Vicki Boykis puts it in her excellent Normcore Tech newsletter, Neural Nets are just people all the way down. Every step of a typical machine learning system is affected by personal choices. Here are a few of those decisions: Inevitably, through this process, different humans will arrive at different conclusions. One example of this is documented in the paper Many Analysts, One Data Set, which describes how data scientists can arrive at conflicting decisions with the same dataset because they employ varied methods. It\\u2019s no exaggeration to say that you can use a single dataset to prove an argument and its antithesis by altering the analysis. What this shows is you shouldn\\u2019t put too much faith in any conclusion drawn from one study, but should instead look (with skepticism) at meta-analyses (and read How to Lie with Statistics). Furthermore, human bias, whether on purpose or by accident, makes its way into the data, thereby influencing machine learning models. As shown in books like Weapons of Math Destruction, ceding decisions to machines does not eliminate discrimination, but codifies existing prejudices that appear in real-world data. The objective, ending biases decisions with data science, is noble, but as long as humans are involved, we cannot blindly rely on machine learning predictions. Does the subjectivity in data science mean we should give up all idea of truth? I think we should reframe the question: instead of searching for the one right answer, we use data science, however flawed, to move in the direction of better solutions. After all, data science is a sub-field of science, with the goal of becoming less wrong over time. Also, the more people working on a problem, and comparing their work, the closer we move to better outcomes. Those 20 scientists might have carried out 20 different analyses, but if they had then compared their methods and worked together, the resulting effort would be superior to any of the individual projects. When practicing data science, we must remember that data science, like any field, is not without its flaws, and should not be trusted without question. Practicing responsible data science means presenting results with uncertainty intervals, looking for reasons to disprove your conclusions, comparing your results to other similar work, and be realistic when presenting findings. Since data science is dependent on human judgment, we need to realize \\u2026 While seemingly obvious (is there any field where communication skills are a negative?), I\\u2019m reminded daily of the need to effectively communicate machine learning to people across the technical spectrum. It\\u2019s not enough to know your ML jargon; you need to be able to meet people where they are in their understanding and tell them only the details they need to know. (As a slightly humorous example, my job is \\u201ccomputer stuff\\u201d to some people and a half-hour discussion on the particulars of machine learning to others.) At least in our case, machine learning decisions do not replace human choices (even when they are more accurate), because it\\u2019s up to the building engineers to use our recommendations. (Autonomous building operating is probably further away than autonomous vehicles). It\\u2019s not enough to build the model, show how accurate it is, and give the results to customers expecting them to implement the predictions immediately. Data scientists still have to master the messy art of social interaction. You can produce the best machine learning model possible, but if you can\\u2019t convince people to use it, then it will have no impact. The most common people aspects of my job are explaining methods, both through writing and presentations to both internal and external groups, understanding how our customers currently make decisions and talking to domain experts to translate their knowledge into data science systems. None of these were mentioned in college, where I was told data scientists could hide behind perfectively objective numbers. Even after you explain how the computer arrived at a decision, the recommendation may be ignored because people are not entirely rational. When presented with an objectively better choice, people may choose another option for all sorts of reasons: habit, lack of trust, familiarity, misinformation. Consider the scenic route choice: sometimes, people, for seemingly no logical reason, will take a significantly longer route between two places. Why? Because there is more beautiful scenery along the way. A naive data scientist might show only the shortest route recommended by the model, but, a data scientist who understands her customers will know they want to see more than endless miles of the interstate on their trip. Likewise, optimal machine learning predictions may not be used because accuracy is not the only consideration. For example, we predict the ideal time for a building engineer to start heating their building, but many engineers will still turn on equipment earlier because they do not want tenants to experience discomfort. This isn\\u2019t rational (we time our recommendations to ensure the building will be at the correct temperature by the time tenants arrive), but, until we remove humans from the decision-making process, we\\u2019re going to have to adapt our computer systems to humans instead of the other way around. Perhaps in addition to your computer science classes, take a few courses in sociology to understand your fellow humans (or read behavioral economic books such as Misbehaving by Richard Thaler or Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahnemann, both Nobel winners in economics). What\\u2019s the best way to ensure your algorithm doesn\\u2019t contain any errors? Import a model from sklearn instead of writing it yourself. Unless you are doing cutting-edge research, there is almost no reason to write your own version of a machine learning model. Instead, use functions from widely used and well-tested libraries, standard tooling, to accomplish tasks. In a recent tweet, I said the worst data scientists write their own algorithms and the best import them from standard libraries. I was sort of joking, but I stand behind the principle that using well-tested code from open-source libraries is almost always more efficient than developing your own code. The logic of using standard tooling applies to more than machine learning models. Everything you could want to do to a dataset is already implemented in pandas (assuming you use Python) so look for a solution there first. Likewise, there are standard libraries for statistics, plotting, testing, scheduling, deploying tasks, and most parts of the machine learning pipeline. I took over my position from 2 Ph.D. data scientists who had felt the urge (probably to justify their degrees) of inventing their own data structures, metrics, algorithms, file loading, etc., which resulted in a mass of jumbled code that no one understood. My first six months of the job were mostly replacing hundred line scripts with three import statements, and, to this day, I\\u2019m proud to be a net-negative contributor to our machine learning library. Moreover, don\\u2019t switch to the new library/technology/framework/database just because it\\u2019s new. Standard tools like SQL databases, sklearn for machine learning, and pandas for data manipulation work fine. They may be bland because they are (relatively) old, but they are also tested and reliable. Being an early adopter may seem fun at first, but it\\u2019ll quickly become exhausting as you battle through bugs and limited documentation. While new technologies drive the media cycle, they often have little to no immediate impact on the people and companies actually doing work (Beware Engineering Media). My younger self cannot believe I\\u2019m saying this, but I now prefer boring, proven technologies to exciting, novel ones that have yet to deliver results. Internally, our engineering team has lengthy debates about upgrading library versions, and, if there\\u2019s no discernible benefit or need, then we don\\u2019t upgrade because there\\u2019s a new release. Adding a library to our machine learning codebase requires a demonstrated need as another library means another dependency to manage. The most long-lived companies are those that do mundane things and move slowly (like Caterpillar), while startups that move fast and do \\u201ccool\\u201d things tend to dissipate in a few years. The most robust machine learning systems are not going to be ones using cutting-edge technologies, but those that stick with the tried-and-tested data science standard tooling. Computers are very good at processing large quantities of numbers. Humans can barely handle comparing a few numbers. To most effectively combine computers\\u2019 and humans\\u2019 abilities, we should use computers to analyze large datasets and present only the most critical figures to humans making decisions. Millions of numbers in, as few numbers as possible out. Complex models on the inside, actionable recommendations on the outside. Over the past year, I\\u2019ve developed a theory that the more data points a chart has, beyond a small number (maybe the number 7?), the less useful it is. Humans just do not have the capacity to analyze complex quantitative diagrams with accuracy. Heatmaps are cool, but has anyone made a crucial decision from a heatmap with 1000s of datapoints in contrast to a bar chart with five numbers? As someone who generally enjoys perusing numbers and listening to details of machine learning models, I\\u2019ve had a hard time getting used to the idea that most people do not want more information. Customers and people making decisions desire the takeaway, and that\\u2019s it. Less ink means a better chart. (If you need help making charts, consult The Visual Display of Quantitative Information or Fundamentals of Data Visualization). The argument for external simplicity does not mean using only linear models. Data science can involve complex algorithms and highly technical operations. Only the external-facing part of data science must be simple enough for a non-technical person to understand. Nonetheless, be careful about making your model so complex that even you don\\u2019t understand it. Is it worth a blended model for a small accuracy gain at the expense of not being able to explain your model? For masking internal complexity with external simplicity, use tools that can help describe a model\\u2019s decision. SHAP values are a useful technique, and you can layer on additional methods. To explain a building\\u2019s optimal start time recommendation, we take SHAP values on all features, including engineered features, and combine them into human-understandable feature groups, like weather and internal building conditions. We take a sophisticated machine learning algorithm, simplify it with SHAP values for us to understand, then streamline it further with our knowledge before presenting to customers. One method for simplifying quantitative information is to prepare a report starting with only one number, and then add other numbers as needed (this also works for graphs). Instead of starting with dozens of figures and removing them, this additive approach ensures that no extraneous stats make it into presentations and reports. Remember that people are not computers, and you shouldn\\u2019t present results as if they are. Finally, because this is a significant issue in data science (and other professions), here\\u2019s a bonus lesson as encouragement: Don\\u2019t let imposter syndrome or mistakes get you down. Everyone feels some sense that they don\\u2019t belong or that they\\u2019ll eventually be \\u201cfound out\\u201d as incapable of the job, so don\\u2019t fret if you do. You\\u2019re not the only one with these thoughts, learning new things is as vital as producing results, and, if you are relatively new, there are benefits to being a novice (like finding new ways to solve problems). Furthermore, it\\u2019s easy to look around and see people achieving great success, but what you don\\u2019t see is all the failures they encountered along the way (a form of survivorship bias). Even the best performer started out as a beginner who made (and continues to make) her share of mistakes. Errors do not mean you shouldn\\u2019t be a data scientist or computer programmer; they mean you have an opportunity to learn how to do things better. We need more people and more diverse people in data science, and I worry we are excluding skilled candidates by portraying data scientists as elite and having data science positions require years of experience. You can only gain expertise by working in a field, it\\u2019s not something you have before starting a career. The fact is there\\u2019s no \\u201ctypical\\u201d path into the data science field. If you think you don\\u2019t belong because of background or inexperience, the good news is that\\u2019s a cognitive distortion; data science is not a profession reserved only for a few elite. After a year in the field, my initial boundless optimism for data science has shifted to cautious enthusiasm. Machine learning can solve a narrow range of problems well (better than humans) but is not a cure-all for human errors. It\\u2019s critical to recognize the limitations of the field to avoid overselling data science. Nonetheless, approached with a realistic attitude and keeping these lessons in mind, machine learning can deliver impressive results. The best machine learning systems will help humans, not supplant them, by allowing us to do our jobs more efficiently. I appreciate feedback and constructive criticism. The best place to reach me is below in the responses, or on twitter @koehrsen_will. Incredibly, after 16 years of schooling, the majority of American college students get this question wrong: The answer, of course, is C, an overall decrease of 4%. Not only did the majority of college students get this question wrong, they did not even get the correct direction, with over half guessing this was an increase. The common error is taking the percentages at face value and adding them together to get the overall percentage change. We thus have another entry in the long list of things people aren\\u2019t very good at, combining multiple percentage changes. Far from being an abstract, theoretical idea, finding a total change from a sequence of percentage moves has implications in our daily lives from the price of consumer goods to national budgets to our retirement account value, to the battery life on our newest laptop. Yet, despite the ubiquity of the error and the ramifications for us personally and as a nation, we are incapable of teaching people how to correctly stack percentages. In this article, we\\u2019ll discuss what the error is, how to avoid it, why this matter, and why people make it. Our primary resource is the paper: \\u201cWhen Two Plus Two Is Not Equal to Four: Errors in Processing Multiple Percentage Changes\\u201d (link). The error is that when we see two consecutive percentage changes, we instinctively take them at face value and add them together to get a total change. Thus, a discount of 50% followed by a discount of 25% is interpreted as 75%. In equation form, for two percentages A and B, the mistake is: The problem is a percentage is calculated from a specific base value. After the first percentage change, the base changes, and the second percentage does not have the same base. Two percentages that have different base values cannot be directly combined by addition! Instead, we have to work out the percentage changes separately. First, calculate the new base from the first percent change, then, using the new base, calculate the percent change from the second. The overall percent change can then be calculated from the new value and the original base value. In equation form, the overall percentage change is: Canceling out the value yields the simpler equation for total percentage change from two sequential percentage changes A and B: The error is in the extra term on the end, A * B. The fortunate part of the mistake is it always occurs in a systematic direction: Let\\u2019s work through examples representing these 4 situations: 2. 2 decreases: suppose the town tax rate decreases by 60% and then by 40% (we can only wish). If we add the 2 together, we pay 0% tax but surely that can\\u2019t be right! Indeed it isn\\u2019t: 3. 1 increase and 1 decrease resulting in an overall increase. Suppose national spending increases by 80% one year and then decreases by 40% the next. What\\u2019s the total change? Notice that the order of the changes does not matter. We could decrease first and then increase, but the overall magnitude of the change is the same. If you don\\u2019t believe me, start with spending of $100. The first order works out: The decrease followed by the increase gives the same answer: 4. 1 increase and 1 decrease resulting in an overall decrease. Suppose the length of a blog post increases by 60% during the first edit and decreases by 40% during the second (this is the same situation as the initial question). Did the post get longer? In the last case, adding the two percentages gets you a 20% increase in what was actually a 4% decrease. Had you made the common error, you would have ended up on the wrong side of 0! A similar error occurred when standardized test scores in California decreased by 60% one year and increased by 72% the next, resulting in praise for the raising of student scores from the baseline. Not to be a downer, but the total overall change \\u2014 wait, work this one out yourself \\u2014 was a 31% decrease in test scores. Students were worse than 2 years previous not better, and their parents were still math illiterate (but not you anymore!). All of the above were hypothetical examples of very real situations. Knowingly or not, we deal with multiple percentage changes all the time and when we don\\u2019t realize this, it\\u2019s usually to our detriment. As with most other human errors, there are people already taking advantage of it for their benefit. (It\\u2019s a good rule of thumb that errors in human logic are discovered first in marketing and only later are they published in academic journals. For more on this, read Influence by Robert Cialdini. ) For example, look at the \\u201cdouble discount\\u201d. This occurs often in retail where you can take an extra 25% off an item on sale for 50% off. The salesperson wants you to add the percentages and conclude the discount is 75% instead of the more modest 62.5% discount for the actual value. Or consider a computer with a display that has 20% more pixels than the last model which had 30% more than the previous. Instead of presenting these increases separately \\u2014 where adding gets you to 50% \\u2014 the seller would be better off presenting them as one number, 56%, which is the actual increase. What the salesperson would be doing in these situations is framing: presenting information in a context to get us to make a decision in her favor. Any piece of data can be presented in multiple ways \\u2014 for example, a medication can be described as having 10% chance of causing a side effect or as having a 90% chance of causing no side effects (the framing here is positive versus negative). Multiple percentage changes are only one example of framing, which has a profound impact on our choices (read about framing in \\u201cThe Framing of Decisions\\u201d by Tversky and Kahnemann). One of the studies in the paper \\u201cWhen Two Plus Two\\u201d looked at the effect of in a retail setting of presenting a discount as a single decrease or two percentage discounts. Not surprisingly, the double discount generated more purchases, more revenue, and more profit than the equivalent single discount. While this was only a single study, the prevalence of double discounts in stores is strong evidence marketers had already figured out and were using this cognitive shortcoming. One theory that explains why we are bad at percentages \\u2014 as well as fractions and decimals \\u2014 is that humans evolved math skills only dealing with whole numbers. \\u201cWhole number dominance\\u201d makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint: things in nature really only come in whole numbers. We\\u2019re never chased by 1.7 mountain lions or must have 2.5 children to carry on the species. Over millions of years, we got pretty good at adding together whole numbers. In more complex situations \\u2014 calculating the compound percentage return on your retirement account \\u2014 our evolved abilities don\\u2019t hold up well. I think the mistake in calculating percentage changes is a combination of our predilection for whole numbers and remaining in system one thinking. If you\\u2019ve read works like \\u201cThinking, Fast and Slow\\u201d, then you are familiar with the concept of the two systems of thinking. The first is a quick, instinctual judgment made using a set of heuristics and biases (mental shortcuts). The second mode is a prolonged, rational decision made by reasoning through multiple pieces of information. The first system works well for situations our ancestors encountered but breaks down in information-rich, constantly changing environments, exactly where we find ourselves now. Calculating the total effect of multiple percentage changes requires switching from 1 to 2 which is effortful and something we try to avoid. Unfortunately, system 1 seems incapable of multiplication and takes a shortcut \\u2014 addition \\u2014 to calculate that a 50% and 25% increase is 75% instead of 87.5%. Another of the studies in \\u201cWhen Two Plus Two\\u201d looked at when we do the multiple percentage calculation correctly. Interestingly, they found we unconsciously make an effort vs payoff tradeoff and only stop to calculate the correct answer when the payoff is worthwhile (for this study, a couple of dollars for the right solution). We should be careful about extrapolating from a single study, but external rewards (sometimes) motivate us to work harder. Similarly, when the percentage changes were easy to compute, say a 20% decrease and a 10% decrease (total of 18% decrease), the error rate went down. Thus, either lowering the effort or increasing the payoff seems to result in more accurate calculations. The third situation where the error rate decreased was when the total from adding percentages was clearly not possible, as with discounts of 80% and 40%. People know that the price of a product cannot decrease by 120% or they would have to be paid to buy it! In summary, we incorrectly calculate multiple percentage changes because it requires effort to reason through the right answer. We are good at adding and using whole numbers, but not so good with multiplication and percentages. The solution is just as straightforward as the problem: take the time to carry out calculations for yourself instead of assuming the answer. Most important decisions in our world requiring recruiting system 2, so you might as well train it at every opportunity! The multiple percentage change error occurs when we take percentages at face value and add them together. The correct approach is to carry out the calculations separately or use the right formula: Yes, it may take a little more effort, but when you are not willing to do the math yourself, it means you will lose out to those who do. I hope that even if your self-confidence took a 40% hit at the beginning of this article, it has since increased by 90% to come out 14% positive. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. The best place to reach me is on Twitter @koehrsen_will. How to Lie With Statistics is a 65-year-old book that can be read in an hour and will teach you more practical information you can use every day than any book on \\u201cbig data\\u201d or \\u201cdeep learning.\\u201d For all promised by machine learning and petabyte-scale data, the most effective techniques in data science are still small tables, graphs, or even a single number that summarize a situation and help us \\u2014 or our bosses \\u2014 make a decision informed by data. Time and again, I\\u2019ve seen thousands of work hours on complex algorithms summarized in a single number. Ultimately, that\\u2019s how the biggest decisions are made: with a few pieces of data a human can process. This is why lessons from \\u201cHow to Lie with Statistics\\u201d (by Darell Huff) are relevant even though each of us probably generates more data in a single day than existed in the entire world at the writing of the book. As producers of tables and graphs, we need to effectively present valid summaries. As consumers of information, we need to spot misleading/exaggerated statistics which manipulate us to take action that benefits someone else at our expense. These skills fall under a category called \\u201cdata literacy\\u201d: the ability to read, understand, argue with, and make decisions from information. Compared to algorithms or big data processing, data literacy may not seem exciting, but it should form the basis for any data science education. Fortunately, these core ideas don\\u2019t change much over time and often the best books on the subject (such as The Visual Display of Quantitative Information) are decades old. The classic book discussed in this article addresses responsible consumption of data in a concise, effective, and enjoyable format. Here are my lessons learned from \\u201cHow to Lie with Statistics\\u201d with commentary from my experiences. When two variables X and Y are correlated \\u2014 meaning they increase together, decrease together, or one goes up as the other does down \\u2014 there are four possible explanations: A. X causes Y B. Y causes X C. A 3rd variable, Z, affects both X and Y D. X and Y are completely unrelated We often immediately jump to \\u2014 or are led to believe \\u2014 A or B when C or D may be as likely. For example, when we hear that more years of college education is positively correlated with a higher income, we conclude that additional years of university lead to greater wealth. However, it could also be a 3rd factor, such as willingness to work hard or parental income, is behind the increase in both more years of tertiary education and higher income. The 3rd hidden variable can lead us to incorrect conclusions about causality. Other times two variables may appear to be correlated, but really have nothing to do with each other. If you make enough comparisons between datasets, you are bound to find some interesting relationships that look to move in sync. Tyler Vigen documents these at Spurious Correlations. We\\u2019ve all heard the advice that correlation does not imply causation, but even when there is a causal effect, it\\u2019s often uncertain which way it goes. Does more praise of students from a teacher lead to higher grades? Do higher grades cause more praise? Or is there a third factor, smaller class sizes or more natural lighting in a class, causing both variables to increase? Questions of cause are answered by randomized controlled trials, not by observational studies where we cannot rule out additional factors that we do not measure. To avoid being misled, approach correlations between variables with skepticism by looking for confounding factors. Humans like neat, causal narratives, but that\\u2019s usually not what the data is telling us. If you have successfully identified a correlation, don\\u2019t assume it lasts forever in either the positive or negative direction. Linear relationships are almost always only linear in a limited region of both variables. Beyond a point, the relationship may become logarithmic, completely disappear, or even reverse. This can be observed in growth curves extrapolated over time. There are periods of linearity where growth occurs at a constant rate, but eventually, growth levels off because almost nothing continues growing indefinitely. Extrapolating beyond the region of applicability for a relationship is known as a generalization error. You are taking a local phenomenon and trying to apply it globally. As people rise out of poverty, they tend to become more satisfied with life. However, once they hit a certain point (perhaps $75,000/year) happiness does not increase with wealth and may even decrease. This suggests there are diminishing returns to increasing wealth, just as there are in many aspects of human activity, like studying for a test. We see extrapolations all the time: growth rates for companies, population demographics, prices of stocks, national spending, etc. Oftentimes, people will use a valid relationship in one region to make a point about a region off the chart (for example claiming that $1 million/year will bring pure bliss). Remember, relationships in a local area do not always apply globally. Even if you have verified a causal relationship \\u2014 or see one in a chart \\u2014 make sure you don\\u2019t understand outside the limited region of validity. Adjusting the axes of a graph to make a point is a classic technique in manipulating charts. As a first principle, the y-axis on a bar chart should always start at 0. If not, it\\u2019s easy to prove an argument by manipulating the range, by for example, turning minor increases into massive changes: Another example of misleading graphs is y-axes with different scales. By carefully adjusting values, you produce surprising trends where none exist. While this may seem like an obvious manipulation, advertisers and newspapers get away with it because people do not read information. Most people see a graph and immediately draw a conclusion from the shape of the lines or bars, exactly as the person who made the graph wants. To counter this, try reading axes values. A simple examination may tell you changes are not as big as they look and trends have been created from nothing! Once you get some practice making graphs, you realize how easy it is to manipulate them to your advantage. The best protection against inaccurate figures may be firsthand practice in making them yourself. (If you want a good book on making legitimate data visualizations, check out The Visual Display of Quantitative Information by Edward Tufte or Fundamentals of Data Visualization by Claus Wilke.) Would you be surprised if I told you the highest cancer rates tend to occur in the counties with the smallest populations? Not that shocking. How about when I add that the lowest cancer rates also tend to occur in counties with the lowest number of people? This a verified example of what occurs with small sample sizes: extreme values. Any time researchers conduct a study, they use what is called a sample: a subset of the population meant to represent the entire population. This might work fine when the sample is large enough and has the same distribution of the larger population, but often, because of limited funding or response rates, psychological, behavioral, and medical studies are conducted with small samples, leading to results that are questionable and cannot be reproduced. Scientists are usually limited to small samples by legitimate problems, but advertisers use small numbers of participants in their favor by conducting many tiny studies, one of which will produce a positive result. Humans are not great at adjusting for sample sizes when evaluating a study which in practice means we treat the results of a 1000 person trial the same as a 10 person trial. This is known as \\u201cinsensitivity to sample size\\u201d or \\u201csample size neglect\\u201d. Here\\u2019s another example; if you consider yourself to be data literate, then you will have no problem with this question: If you guessed 2., then congratulations, you are data literate! The reasoning is the smaller the sample size, the more extreme the values. (This is from Judgment under Uncertainty: Heuristics and Biases by Tversky and Kahnemann. I\\u2019d highly recommend reading this paper and Thinking, Fast and Slow, to learn about cognitive biases that affect our decision-making.) You can test the principle that small samples produce extreme results by flipping a coin. With a small sample, say 5 tosses, there is a good chance you get 4 tails. Does this mean the coin always comes up 80% tails? No, this means your sample is too small to draw any significant conclusions. This trick is often used when marketing products by asking a small number of people about a particular brand. You can get impressive-sounding numbers (90% of doctors like this toothpaste) if you repeatedly survey small groups and only report the favorable results. Ask a small group, look at the results, throw away the bad, and repeat until you get the stats you need! The solution to avoid being fooled by small sample sizes is to just look for the number of observations in the data. If not given, then assume whoever took the study has something to hide and the statistics are worthless. Behavioral scientists have shown that most of us are fallible to neglecting sample size; don\\u2019t make the same mistake \\u2014 trust a large number of observations, not shocking statistics from small samples. Checking the sample size can be one way to avoid getting fooled by data, but only if the sample size is provided. Another trick used to mislead consumers of data is to avoid listing relevant numbers that describe a dataset, such as the count of observations, the spread of the data (range), the uncertainty about the data (standard error), the quantiles of the data, and so on. Each of these can be used to get a deeper dive into the data, which often goes against the interest of whoever presents the dataset. For instance, if you hear that the average (more on this below) temperature in a city is 62 degrees F for the year, that is not helpful without knowing the maximum and minimum. The city could get as cold as -20 F and as warm as 120 F but still average out to a comfortable value. In this case, as in many others, a single number is not adequate to describe a dataset. As another example from the book, if you have two children, one of whom tests a 99 on IQ and the other a 102, you really should not tell them to avoid comparisons. Why? Because IQ tests can have a standard error of around 3 points which means a child scoring a 99 once would be expected to score between 96 and 102 about 68% of the time. The overall difference might not be significant and could reverse itself in repeated testing. In other words, by leaving out the expected standard error in the results, you can draw a more drastic conclusion than that offered by the data. Studies that don\\u2019t report more than one number usually have something to hide. Likewise, if a graph looks like it cuts off some of the data, it\\u2019s not trustworthy. It\\u2019s too easy to change a narrative by subsetting data. Think of it this way: if there was a medicine that increased lifespan by 2 years on average would you take it? Would it change your mind if the worst impact was a loss of 12 years of life and the maximum a gain of 14 years? It usually is the details that matter and one summary statistic cannot tell the whole story. Another useful way to tell whatever story you want with data is to vary the definition of \\u201caverage\\u201d. You have 3 options (maybe more if you\\u2019re clever): I\\u2019ve written about this issue before (see here for details), and the basic idea is: the mean and median of a distribution are the same only if it is normal and we live in a world with mostly non-normal data. This means the mean and median of a dataset are not the same value, often by a considerable amount. For example, the mean and median income in the United States differ by about $16,000. By choosing which value to report as the average, politicians, marketers, and CEOs can draw opposing conclusions from the same data. The way to avoid this is to look at the mean, median, and mode of a dataset (again you need all these numbers!). Figure out which one is most appropriate (usually the median for highly skewed datasets such as income, city size, life span, housing prices and so on) and use that if you need a one figure summary. If you can, graph the entire set of values in a histogram and look at the distribution. Try to use more than a single number to describe a dataset, and if you report an average, specify which you are using! When viewing a statistic, the important question often is not what is the value, but how does the current value compare to the previous value? In other words, what is the relative change compared to the absolute magnitude. If I tell you the US GDP was $19.39 trillion in 2017, that sounds incredible because of your everyday experience. However, if you compare that to US GDP in the previous year, $18.62 trillion, it doesn\\u2019t look nearly as impressive. Data is often on scales with which we are unfamiliar, and we need a comparison to other numbers to know if a statistic represents a real change. Is a mean radius of 3389 km for Mars large? I have no conception of what that means until it\\u2019s compared to other planets! Not only do we want to compare a statistic to values in the past and to numbers in the same category, but we also want to make sure the definition of the stat doesn\\u2019t change. According to \\u201cHow to Lie\\u201d, The number of farms in the US increased from 1930 to 1935 by 500,000 because the definition of a farm from the Census Bureau changed! The easiest way to lower unemployment is just to change the definition to exclude people who have stopped looking for work. Changes in the way data is gathered or in the definition of values can often produce extreme results mistaken for actual trends. To counter this, first, look at the entire series of values for perspective. Second, make sure the definition has not changed over the time range. Only then can you start to draw conclusions from the data series. You can scare people by saying New York had 289 murders in 2018, but when you compare that to 2245 in 1990, you realize New York City has never been safer! It\\u2019s usually the comparison that matters; don\\u2019t let an isolated number sway your rational thinking. Remember when we talked about all data being gathered from samples which we hope are representative of the population? In addition to being concerned about sample size, we also need to look for any bias in the sample. This could come from the measurement method used: a landline phone screen might favor wealthier, older participants. It could also come from the physical location: surveying only people who live in cities because it\\u2019s cheaper might bias results toward more progressive views. Sample bias is particularly prevalent in political polling where 2016 showed that sometimes samples are not representative of an entire population. When examining a study, we need to ask who is being included in the sample and who is being excluded. For decades, psychology and sociology studies have been hurt by the WEIRD bias. Samples only included people (often college students) from Western, Education, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic, Nations. It\\u2019s hard to reasonably say a survey represents all of humanity when the participants are this limited! We should also look for sampling bias in our sources of information. Most of us now impose information selection bias on our selves by choosing sources that we tend to agree with. This leads to dangerous situations where we don\\u2019t encounter people who have different opinions and so we grow more entrenched in our views. The solution to this is simple but difficult: read different sources of news, particularly those that don\\u2019t agree with you. If you are a New York Times reader, try the Wall Street Journal for a while. For those who are feeling adventurous, you can even try talking to people who disagree with you. While this may seem intimidating, I\\u2019ve found that people who disagree outwardly often have more in common \\u2014 the same core driving desires \\u2014 motivating them to choose their respective sides. It\\u2019s much easier to come to a common understanding in person but even engaging in civil discourse online is possible and productive and can help you escape a self-imposed information-selection bias. In summary, we need to be wary both of outside sampling bias and self-created sampling bias from our choice of media sources. You would not like someone telling you to read only a single newspaper, so don\\u2019t do the same to yourself. Diverse viewpoints lead to better outcomes, and incorporating different sources of information with varying opinions will give you a better overall picture of events. We can\\u2019t always get to the complete truth of a matter, but we can at least see it from multiple sides. Similarly, when reading a study, make sure you recognize that the sample may not be indicative of the entire population and try to figure out which way the bias goes. Huff describes the idea of an \\u201cO.K name\\u201d as one added to a study to lend it an air of authority. Medical professionals (doctors), universities, scientific institutions, and large companies have names that lead us to automatically trust the results they produce. However, many times these \\u201cexperts\\u201d did not actually produce the work but only were tangentially involved and the name has been added to sway us. Other times, such as when cigarette makers used doctors to sell their deadly products, the authorities are directly paid to lie. One way to avoid being persuaded by an impressive name is to \\u201cmake sure the name on the study stands behind the study and not beside it.\\u201d Don\\u2019t see an institutional name and immediately assume the study is infallible. I don\\u2019t think we should look at the author or university until we\\u2019ve analyzed the statistics to avoid any unconscious bias we impose on ourselves. Even when the results come from a confirmed \\u201cexpert\\u201d that does not mean you should accept them without question. The argument from authority is a fallacy that occurs when we assume someone with greater power is more likely to be correct. This is false because past success has no bearing on whether current results are correct. As Carl Sagan put it: \\u201cAuthorities must prove their contentions like everybody else.\\u201d (from The Demon-Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark). No one is above skepticism, as we\\u2019ve seen throughout the history of science (remember when Aristotle said there were 5 elements? or when the president of IBM said \\u201cI think there is a world market for maybe five computers\\u201d.) Many of the greatest findings have come from challenging authority and accepted wisdom. A statistic with a big name attached should get just as much scrutiny as any other. Statistics and data have no allegiance to a higher power. The overall theme of \\u201cHow to Lie with Statistics\\u201d is: view any single statistic with skepticism. Any number represents a distillation of a set of data, which was taken on a sample of a population by mistake-prone humans, using imperfect tools, in constantly changing conditions at a single point in time. The data was analyzed by another human, who works for an institution, which may have outside funders with differing motivations. Finally, the statistic or graph was delivered to you by a publisher that has its own interests in getting you to believe one idea. All this leads to two conclusions: We should not completely abandon statistics and data gathering. With the right design, studies can find critical trends \\u2014 smoking is bad for you, chloroflourocarbons created a hole in the ozone layer, greater wealth leads to more happiness, and flouridated water vastly improves dental health\\u2014 that then lead to better overall outcomes. Rather, we need to acknowledge data gathering and processing is an uncertain process with many factors influencing the final numbers we see. Humans are variable, and the world is variable \\u2014 that\\u2019s part of what makes it so great to be living in it \\u2014 and so we should be wary of statistics claiming to summarize it neatly in one graph or table. We should look for the range of values, report numbers with confidence intervals, gather more data before jumping to conclusions, compare multiple studies, and ask about the design of the data-gathering process. We need to admit that we are wrong and change our minds when the burden of evidence is irrefutable. There may not be objective truths that hold for the entire universe, but we can become less wrong over time. That is basically the goal of science: light a little more of the darkness with each new study. This should also be the goal of data science: uncover a bit more of the structure of our world with each new dataset. At the same time, we need to recognize the limits of data and not over-generalize. More data is not a panacea, but more data with debate, multiple analyses, and scrutiny can lead to better real-world decisions and that\\u2019s what we hope for as data literate citizens. If I\\u2019ve learned anything in the data science field, it\\u2019s that the most effective way to spend my time is to make a bar chart with 4 numbers. Machine learning modeling is cutting-edge, but in the end, all the CEO wants to see is a simple chart from which she can draw a conclusion. There is nothing inherently wrong with this: as data scientists, our job is to extract meaning from large quantities of data. Meaning does not imply showing hundreds of numbers, it means displaying a limited few with high value. How we present those numbers can make a large impact on how \\u2014 or if \\u2014 they are used. Data literacy means having the skills to interpret graphs, charts, and statistics and draw actionable conclusions. These conclusions do not have to agree with whoever produced the chart, and you should be skeptical when they do. As consumers of data products, we need to understand how easy it is to manipulate data to prove a point or turn a negative into a positive. Getting practice reading statistics and visualizations \\u2014 actually reading a figure \\u2014 helps. Another useful tactic is to make a lot of charts yourself. Practice using the best techniques and make sure to not deliberately mislead others. The world is not a bad place, but there are people who don\\u2019t have your best wishes at heart. Often, they\\u2019ll use data as a tool to convince you to act in their interest and against your own. The best shield against these tactics is basic data literacy: understand how data can be manipulated and the ways you can break through the misconceptions. A healthy dose of skepticism is good for you personally and for the entire field of data science. With these lessons in mind, get out there and be a responsible producer and consumer of data. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Most people see the headline \\u201c90% of Drivers Consider Themselves Above Average\\u201d and think \\u201cwow, other people are terrible at evaluating themselves objectively.\\u201d What you should think is \\u201cthat doesn\\u2019t sound so implausible if we\\u2019re using the mean for average in a heavily negative-skewed distribution.\\u201d Although a headline like this is often used to illustrate the illusion of superiority, (where people overestimate their competence) it also provides a useful lesson in clarifying your assertions when you talk statistics about data. In this particular case, we need to differentiate between the mean and median of a set of values. Depending on the question we ask, it is possible for 9/10 drivers to be above average. Here\\u2019s the data to prove it: The distinction is whether we use mean or median for \\u201caverage\\u201d driver skill. Using the mean, we add up all the values and divide by the number of values, giving us 8.03 for this dataset. Since 9 of the 10 drivers have a skill rating greater than this, 90% of the drivers could be considered above average! The median, in contrast, is found by ordering the values from lowest to highest and selecting the value where half the data points are smaller and half are larger. Here it\\u2019s 8.65 with 5 drivers below and 5 above. By definition, 50% of drivers are below the median and 50% exceed the median. If the question is \\u201cdo you consider yourself better than 50% of other drivers?\\u201d than 90+% of drivers cannot truthfully answer in the affirmative. (The median is a particular case of a percentile (also called a quantile), a value at which the given % of numbers are smaller. The median is the 50th quantile: 50% of numbers in a dataset are smaller. We could also find the 90th quantile, where 90% of values are smaller or the 10th quantile, where 10% of values are smaller. Percentiles are an intuitive way to describe a dataset.) This might appear to be a contrived example or a technicality, but data where the mean and median are not in agreement come up often in the real world. The mean is equal to the median when values are symmetrically distributed. However, real-world datasets almost always have a measure of skew, either positive or negative: In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is greater than the median. This occurs when a relatively few number of outliers on the upper end of the graph \\u201cskew\\u201d it rightward, while the majority of the values are clustered at lower values. A real-world situation is personal income, where the mean income is significantly greater than the median income. The following plot shows the US income distribution in 2017 as 100 percentiles in a histogram. The exact numbers vary by source (this data is from here) but the overall pattern is clear: a few very high earners skew the graph towards the right (positive) raising the mean above the median. At a value of $55880, the mean is close to the 66th percentile. The interpretation is 66% of Americans make less than the average national income \\u2014 when the average is taken to be the mean! This phenomenon occurs in nearly every country. An example of a negatively skewed distribution is age at death. In this dataset, there are, unfortunately, some deaths at a relatively young age, lowering the mean and skewing the graph leftward (negatively). In the case of a negative skew, the median is greater than the mean. The result is that more people can be above the \\u201caverage\\u201d when the average is defined as mean. \\u201cMajority of people live longer than average\\u201d might be a strange headline, but if you choose your stats carefully, you can make it true. Most datasets involving human behavior exhibit some kind of skew. Stock market returns, income, social media followers, battle deaths, and sizes of cities are all highly skewed distributions. In Antifragile, Nassim Taleb describes this world of skewed outcomes as extremistan. We evolved in mediocristan, where all datasets are normally distributed, but our modern lives are now dominated by unequal distributions. Living in extremistan presents opportunities for incredible rewards, but these will only accrue to a very small number of people. It also means we have to be careful when talking about means and medians as the \\u201caverage\\u201d representation of a dataset. (Zip\\u2019s Law and other power laws also produce skewed distributions.) The point to remember is when you specify \\u201caverage\\u201d, you need to clarify whether you are talking about the mean or the median because it makes a difference. The world is not symmetrically distributed, and, therefore, we should not expect the mean and median of a distribution to be the same. Machine learning may get all the attention, but the really important parts of data science are those we use every day: basic statistics to help us understand the world. Being able to tell the difference between a mean and a median may seem mundane, but it\\u2019ll be a lot more relevant to your daily life than knowing how to build a neural network. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Consider the following situation: you\\u2019re trying to practice your soccer skills, but each time you take to the field, you encounter some problems: your shoes are on the wrong feet, the laces aren\\u2019t tied correctly, your socks are too short, your shorts are too long, and the ball is the wrong size. This is a ridiculous situation, but it\\u2019s analogous to that many data scientists find themselves in due to a few common, easily solvable issues: All of these mistakes \\u201ctrip\\u201d you up, costing you time and valuable mental resources worrying about small details. Instead of solving data science problems, you find yourself struggling with incidental difficulties trying to set up your environment or get your code to run. Fortunately, the above issues are simple to fix with the right tooling and approach. In this article, we\\u2019ll look at best practices for a data science programming environment that will give you more time and concentration for working on the problems that matter. Nothing is more frustrating than writing code that works perfectly one day and then discovering it has numerous errors the next without you changing a character. Almost every time I encounter this problem, it has a single cause: failing to keep track of which version of libraries you are using in your code. This problem is so common and so frustrating that its name is dependency hell. To get over this, you have to remember libraries have versions: when you say you use pandas, that\\u2019s incorrect; you actually use pandas==0.24.0 or pandas==0.19.2 , etc. Every library you import in a project will be at a specific version and recording the version for your project is crucial to avoid terrible moments of broken code. There are many options for fixing this revolving around the idea of creating an isolated environment: a managed installation of Python with its own packages separate from your system Python. (Real Python has great tutorials on all these tools). pip freeze > requirements.txt is not good enough: you need to use virtual environments (which can be created from a requirements.txt) to ensure libraries match the expected version. A virtual env also has a specified version of Python removing the problem of different Python installs. The approach you choose depends on the needs of your team and how much time you want to invest. For example, I use conda environments for personal work and pipenv at work. I\\u2019m not going to make a recommendation except to say: pick one and use it! You should never be doing data science without knowing the version of every library you call. If you had to make a choice of how many spaces to use on each line of a script, you\\u2019d have no time left over for thinking about the actual code! Most people\\u2019s formatting tendencies are not that bad, but they are close. You should never have to make conscious decisions about code format: things like spaces around keyword parameters, length of lines, blank lines between functions, trailing commas after the last item in a list, etc; factors dealing only with how the code looks. Instead of making a choice on each line, make one global decision \\u2014 adopt one style for your project \\u2014 and never worry about it again. At work, my team uses the black autoformatting tool which applies a standard code style across our entire project and just fixes the mistakes \\u2014 no need to think about it. I have it set to auto-run every time I save a Python file in vscode. black works so well and is so easy to use that I use it for all my personal work as well. There are other auto-formatting or linting options for Python and other languages. I\\u2019d suggest adopting a set of code style standards and using a tool to check all your files for usage. Spending more effort than required on code formatting is just a bad use of your precious time. In another application of the \\u201cmake a global decision once instead of many local decisions\\u201d idea, you should establish naming conventions for a project. These should cover variables, functions, classes, files, tests, and directories. Naming conventions should also include standardized abbreviations for units (such as kph ) and for aggregations ( min, max). I\\u2019ve written about naming variables here. The choice of exact conventions does not matter as much using them consistently. Agree on standards across your whole team (which might just be you), write them down in a common location, and then follow them without deviation. At code reviews, (another crucial best practice) enforce the standards so everyone is on the same page. This tip is again about having to reduce the number of conscious decisions you make. When you are writing names for functions, variables, etc, there should be one very obvious choice based on the code and your conventions. If you are struggling, adopt a standard convention used by another project. Don\\u2019t be dogmatic and refuse to change because you\\u2019ve always done things one way. There is no place for rigid, unchanging personal beliefs in programming. Make conventions, write them down, apply them, and stop spending time on the incidental problems of data science. Everyone on your team should use the same development environment, no exclusions. As a lifelong (22 years) Windows user, I gave zero thought to protesting against using MacOS for development at my current position (Cortex Building Intelligence). There simply was no choice to make: everyone else uses a Mac, so that\\u2019s what I had to use for standardization across the team. I\\u2019m not going to advocate for one system over another (here are the numbers on which is the most used) but I will argue vociferously for everyone on the same team to use the same operating system. \\u201cIt worked on my machine\\u201d is the one statement no data scientist ever wants to hear. Even when using the same libraries, I\\u2019ve seen this problem because of different operating systems. Our team can be more productive when I know that an analysis I write on my machine will work on everyone else\\u2019s (thanks to the os and dependency management). Moreover, when anyone on our team needs to install new software, we can all use the same exact commands to do so. It\\u2019s not fun for the person who has to adopt a new operating system, but it\\u2019s necessary for the good of the team. Correcting this practice was probably the biggest change for me coming from a research data science background to industry: programs and individual scripts should be written in an integrated development environment, not Jupyter Notebooks. The notebook is great for exploration, learning, graphing, and literate programming, but you shouldn\\u2019t develop an unhealthy habit of depending on it for writing all code. Jupyter Notebooks are a terrible place to write actual programs with many scripts because of the lack of tooling: no linting, no auto-formatting code across a project, poor file browsing, no project-wide find and replace, no built-in testing framework, poor debugging, no integrated terminal, and so on. No, Jupyter Lab does not solve these problems; it still is not a place where you can or should be developing scripts. Breaking out of notebooks is intimidating because it requires you to hold larger pieces of information in your head at once. Instead of blocks of code, you need to think about code in terms of entire scripts consisting of many functions and classes. Moreover, a notebook presents a linear path of code executed from top to bottom, when a real program has many interlocking pieces that form a cycle. One script may import from 10 others in your module with pieces interacting in a complicated structure. I don\\u2019t want to get into coding best practices, but the environment in which you develop has a massive impact on how you think about and write code. A proper integrated development environment gets you thinking about data science code not as isolated notebooks, but as a software product: one with many interlocking pieces and complicated interactions. There are many great choices for an IDE. I recommend experimenting with a few to find the right complexity and number of features you need. Personally, I use Visual Studio Code, which has become the most popular editor for software engineers. vscode gives me everything mentioned above and more through extensions (including a built-in browser and git integration). I spend about 90% of my coding time within Visual Studio Code and I\\u2019ve come to like it just as much as the Jupyter Notebook. There is nothing fundamentally wrong about Jupyter Notebooks, they just were never meant for developing serious programs. When used correctly (implementing the concept of literate programming) they are a great tool. However, as with any tool, notebooks can be used in places where they are not appropriate. When you want to start writing production code, you will have to switch to an integrated development environment. Even if you aren\\u2019t there yet, I\\u2019d recommend becoming familiar with the idea of writing scripts instead of notebooks and composing together many scripts into a library (which you can import into a notebook for analysis). Not using an IDE for developing programs is a serious obstacle: be nice to your working self and start using a full-featured programming environment. In his excellent paper \\u201cNo Silver Bullet\\u201d, David Brooks discusses the idea of accidental vs essential problems in software engineering. The gains in productivity in software engineering over the past 40 years came about through the reduction of accidental problems \\u2014 those related to translating ideas into code \\u2014 and the essential difficulties \\u2014 thinking up the ideas \\u2014 remain. In data science, I still see many people struggling with incidental difficulties, tripping themselves up before they can even start coding because they don\\u2019t have a good environment or do not adhere to simple practices. As a field, I think we can do better. Let\\u2019s spend less time on the accidental difficulties of data science \\u2014 managing dependencies, code formatting, naming, operating systems, and code editors \\u2014 and more time on the essential difficulties \\u2014 developing algorithms, building models, engineering features, and deploying trained models (and fighting climate change with machine learning). By adopting the practices outlined in this article, you\\u2019ll have more time and mental resources to solve the problems that really matter. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Author\\u2019s Note: this is my personal statement for application to Georgia Tech\\u2019s Online Master\\u2019s in Computer Science (OMSCS). This degree, ranked 8th in the country for Computer Science, is the best deal in graduate education (at least in the United States) coming in under $7,000. (Compared to over $70,000 for degrees at lower-rated institutions.) It\\u2019s designed for working professionals, which means I\\u2019ll be working full-time at Cortex Building Intel as I pursue the degree. While this is still a work in progress, and I haven\\u2019t yet been accepted, I thought I\\u2019d share and any feedback is much appreciated. If I get in, I\\u2019m very much looking forward to continuing my education which is a must for anyone in the field of data science! Update July 12, 2019: I have been accepted into the program. I will be attending the Online Master\\u2019s in Computer Science starting January 2020. My objective is to make the greatest positive social impact. After several years figuring out what that means, I\\u2019ve concluded I can do the most for our planet working as a data scientist in the energy sector, addressing current inefficiencies and leading a transition to clean energy. There are three enablers of this goal: motivation, experience, and education. The drive to work diligently is not a barrier; I\\u2019ve always been self-motivated as seen in my top marks in formal academic settings, my rigorous self-study of computer/data science, and earning a software engineering job at a start-up doing beneficial, challenging work. I\\u2019m working on the experience aspect; through my position as Cortex Building Intelligence, a start-up applying big data, software, and data science to reduce the energy use of office buildings, I am continually expanding my computer and data science skillset. Every day, I\\u2019m able to apply computer science topics (databases, algorithms, machine learning, distributed computing) to develop and deploy pipelines now running in production, learning by doing. Although I eventually want to switch to the public sector, previous stints at the Air Force and NASA taught me a fast-moving company might be a better choice for a young engineer to rapidly acquire experience. The third pillar supporting my objective is education. While my undergraduate degree was in mechanical engineering (by the time I decided on a career in data science it was too late to switch), it taught me problem-solving skills and how to tackle large projects. I supplemented formal education with self-study and work on a research project building software for virtual building energy audits. While my current level of knowledge allows me to do my job effectively, I know there are advanced concepts \\u2014 both in computer science and machine learning \\u2014 which, if mastered, would increase my ability to contribute. While some of these topics can be learned through other online resources or experience, I value sustained study in a formal setting. The Online Master\\u2019s in Computer Science from Georgia Tech fits well into my plans: I\\u2019ll be able to immerse myself in a rigorous learning experience, study advanced techniques in machine learning and computer science, engage with other learners and professors, and continue to work full time in a rewarding job, applying the topics covered in class. Looking over the course list is exciting as I imagine the benefits \\u2014 at my current job and throughout my career \\u2014 these classes will have, in addition to the joy that comes with learning new skills. Why study computer science if I want to be a data scientist? From my experiences, I\\u2019ve learned one can\\u2019t isolate data science from computer science if she intends to deploy solutions. On every machine learning pipeline, the determining factor in whether we can build the implementation is not data science \\u2014 this is relatively simple with open-source tools \\u2014 but the infrastructure required to store, load, and process data, send the data through a model, and serve the model\\u2019s predictions to clients on a real-time basis. To develop more ambitious data science systems, I do need to study machine learning, but I also need to master advanced topics in computer science such as High-Performance Computing and Big Data Analysis. Through the OMSCS, with a specialization in machine learning, I\\u2019ll be well-equipped to build larger, more impactful systems, taking full advantage of big data and increasing computing resources. To summarize, my goal is to have the most significant positive impact, which I believe will come as a data scientist in the energy field. I already have the motivation to contribute, I\\u2019ll continue to gain critical experience working at Cortex Building Intelligence, and the OMSCS from Georgia Tech will provide me with the education required to exceed my objective. My goal is admittedly ambitious, but we need ambitious people to solve our current and future problems. I write mostly about data science and sometimes about other interesting life experiences. You can find my work on Towards Data Science and my projects on GitHub. Amara\\u2019s Law states we tend to overestimate the effect of a technology in the short term but underestimate the effect in the long term. We see this play out repeatedly with technologies ranging from trains to the internet to now machine learning. The trend is nearly always the same: initial, wildly optimistic claims about the capabilities of an innovation are followed by a period of disillusionment when it fails to deliver before finally, we figure out how to use the technology and it goes on to fundamentally reshape our entire world (this is known as the hype cycle). The basic idea of Amara\\u2019s Law \\u2014 smaller short-term effects than claimed but much larger long-term effects than was imagined \\u2014 can also be seen repeatedly in the overall effect of technology on the job humans do. The first steel plow, invented in the 1830s, did not immediately displace all farmers, but over the period from 1850 to modern times, the percentage of people working agriculture jobs in the US went from >50% to <2%. (Through a combination of innovations, not just mechanical technology, a far smaller percentage of people now produce a vastly larger amount of food.) Likewise, US manufacturing jobs went from 40% of the total jobs to less than 10%, not in one or two years, but over decades (through a combination of automation and outsourcing). Again we see minor ripples over the course of a few years, but a fundamental restructuring of the economy over a long enough time period. Moreover, it\\u2019s critical to point out that people always find other jobs. Today, we have the lowest unemployment levels in 50 years, because when some jobs are automated, humans simply switch to new jobs. We constantly invent new careers to meet our needs, including the entire service economy (which employs the majority of Americans since the decline of agriculture and manufacturing), or, on a personal level, the role of data scientist, which became widely recognized only in 2012. It\\u2019s worth keeping these two points \\u2014 change takes time and we\\u2019ll always invent new jobs for humans\\u2014 in mind when we think about the effects of automation in current times. It can be easy to get carried away with reports claiming \\u201cNearly Half of Jobs Are Vulnerable to Automation\\u201d which seem to imply we should be concerned about masses of unemployed workers within a few years. Thinking in terms of Amara\\u2019s Law, I would argue this study is underestimating the percentage of jobs which will be done by machines: 99% of our jobs will be rendered obsolete because of new technology, but only over a long enough time scale. As our jobs are gradually automated, we\\u2019ll simply move along to the next, likely a career that has not yet been invented. With that being said, it\\u2019s still interesting to think about which jobs are likely to be automated in the short term and why, so we can focus on learning the skills where humans add the most value. In his excellent book The Fourth Age: Smart Robots, Conscious Computers, and the Future of Humanity, Byron Reese lays out the characteristics of jobs at high risk for automation. These are: In addition to describing these traits in detail, Reese outlines a handy tool for determining the \\u201cautomation risk\\u201d of your job. The following 10 questions are no guarantee a job will be or will not be automated, but they do provide a framework for quantifying what to most people is usually an emotional question: \\u201cwill robots take my job?\\u201d (the answer is that most people think machines won\\u2019t take their job, but will take other people\\u2019s jobs. I\\u2019ll go through the questions and answer them based on what I\\u2019ve learned as a data scientist. This is not meant to be an objective analysis of the entire field \\u2014 every position is different, so feel free to disagree. For background, I\\u2019ve spent 2 years in the data science field: 1 year on a graduate research project, 2 months as a data analyst intern at Pratt and Whitney, 4 months as a data scientist at Feature Labs, and 6 months as a full-time data scientist at Cortex Building Intelligence. I\\u2019m primarily answering these questions with respect to my current job at Cortex, where we use big data and machine learning to increase energy efficiency of commercial office buildings (proving you can make a positive environmental and economic impact at the same time). We are a small startup (~10 people) and I neither manage any employees nor have a formal manager although I work closely with a senior software engineer. This test is scored out of 100 with a higher score indicating greater vulnerability to automation. (The test appears in Chapter 10 of the book but I\\u2019d encourage you to read the entire book. You can also take the test online for yourself; I\\u2019ve rephrased some of the questions for clarity). 4 / 10. While writing code can occasionally feel formulaic, a job as a data scientist involves more than building machine learning models. Some days I may spend refactoring code (something I\\u2019ll be glad to hand over to machines), some days I\\u2019ll run a one-off data analysis for a client, and other days I\\u2019ll have to go to a building to adjust some faulty sensors to get reliable data. (Oh, you thought all data comes neatly packaged and hand-delivered in a clean csv file? Well, welcome to the real world, where getting data means crawling around the basement of an office building to reconnect an electric meter). In short, the day-to-day similarity is low which makes the job exciting and less susceptible to a machine takeover. 2. How often do you have to move physical locations at your job? (0: never, 10: at all times) 6 / 10. For most data scientists/software engineers, I\\u2019m guessing this answer is higher on the scale because you work in the same office at the same desk every day. For my role, I do spend a lot of time at one desk, but I also go to different buildings around New York City. (Again, you can\\u2019t do data science without data and getting that data requires significant effort.) Moreover, I split time between our offices in NYC and HQ in Washington, DC, because, at the end of the day, face-to-face conversations are most effective. 3. How many people know of or do your job? (0: almost none, 10: many) 5 / 10. When you are in a field, it can be easy to get caught in a filter bubble where you think your job is Very Important and therefore everyone must know about it. Even a few short conversations with people outside the field will dispel you of this notion, as I have found with data science. Few people outside of the tech space have heard the term \\u201cdata scientist\\u201d let alone know what one does. I\\u2019ve resorted to saying I analyze data, and if that doesn\\u2019t get across to people, I\\u2019ll mention something about computers and spreadsheets. In general, the more specialized the job (meaning fewer workers are doing it), the less likely it is to be automated because there is less incentive to invest the resources needed to build a machine capable of the job. 4. How long is the training for your job? (0: years, 10: days) 0 / 10. Training for data science is extensive \\u2014 you cannot learn all there is to know in a 6 or even 12-week bootcamp. Although I don\\u2019t believe a 4-year degree is necessary to be successful, you will need to study for a prolonged time and gain experience solving actual problems before you can be an effective data scientist in industry. Furthermore, the job requires constant learning, always being on the lookout for new tools and better methods to solve your problems. Any machine taught data science would need a \\u201cmental upgrade\\u201d about every 6 months to stay current. 5. Does your job require repetitive physical actions? (0: not at all, 10: completely) 8 / 10. My answer is again probably lower than most other data scientists since I have to help integrate our technology at buildings. This is one area where we don\\u2019t stand a chance next to machines; computers are absolutely great at repeatedly doing the same thing millions of times with no mistakes. If we could just tell the computers the correct keys to type, we\\u2019d immediately be out of a job. 6. What is the longest time you need to make a decision? (0: more than 5 minutes, 10: few seconds) 0 / 10 Reese (the author of the test) sets the maximum time for this question at 5 minutes which seems awfully short. There are decisions we make at Cortex that take weeks of poring over results and deliberation among employees at all levels of the company. Almost our decisions involve not only quantitative metrics (numbers) but qualitative measures (can we explain this to our clients, are the features human-understandable). The data science solutions we build are not determined solely by the one with the lowest error, but through reasoned decision taking into account many different needs. 7. Does your job require an emotional connection to other people? (0: absolutely necessary, 10: not at all necessary) 5 / 10. If you thought you could escape people by becoming a data scientist, then sorry, you\\u2019ve chosen the wrong profession. Working successfully at a company requires constant communication: in a typical day, I may talk to clients, the CEO, the sales team, and the customer success team, all of whom respond best to different approaches (quantitative vs qualitative, assertive vs open-ended). That is not even considering my conversations with other engineers which involve code reviews, looking at model outputs, developing new solutions to problems, debating code style, etc. In short, hone up on your communication skills if you plan to work at any company. 8. Is creativity required at your job? (0: entire basis of job, 10: creativity actively discouraged) 4 / 10. Perhaps I am overstating how much creativity I perceive goes into data science, but we constantly face new problems that can\\u2019t be solved with the same approaches, which means we need to \\u201cthink differently\\u201d. If we consider creativity to include the ability to use many different tools, then data science has to rank high on the scale. I wish there were established best practices for solving problems in data science, but for better or worse, that is not the case. Therefore my job requires trying out numerous approaches to every problem and sometimes developing my own if no existing ones will do. 9. Do you directly manage employees? (0: many, 10: none) 10 / 10. As an individual contributor, I do not directly manage any employees. Nonetheless, managing is certainly not out of the question for a data scientist. 10. Would someone else do your job in the same way? (0: not at all, 10: exactly the same) 4 / 10. At this point in the evolution of data science, the answer is a solid no. There are too many ways to solve data science problems for two people to use the same method. I\\u2019ve had occasions to re-implement modeling pipelines that were built several years ago, and each time I\\u2019ve been struck by how much easier the code is to write now with up-to-date tools. In addition to the tools, fundamental approaches can differ: use a simple model with extensive feature engineering, or limit the features and use a complex model. Eventually, the data science field may collapse on a few approaches, but even at that point, there will still be plenty of room for individual nuance when doing the job. According to Reese, any job below 70 is safe for an entire career. Although I think data science is at no risk of being automated (be skeptical of companies trying to sell you automated data science tools )in the short term, I\\u2019m not confident the role of \\u201cdata scientist\\u201d will still exist a decade from now. Instead, I think data science tools will continue to get easier to use until non-specialists can employ them effectively. At that point, data science will be an essential skill, but one not limited to a handful of experts and we won\\u2019t need anyone trained specifically in data science. I\\u2019m hopeful for this time, because I\\u2019ve repeatedly seen the importance of domain expertise for building effective data science pipelines. If we can put the right tools in the hands of those with experience in a field, then data science can deliver on its promises of increasing efficiency and enabling objective decisions. In summary, automation is not likely to take data science jobs, but if the right tools are developed, data scientist may become an extraneous specialization. There are more realistic problems facing data science than the immediate specter of robots taking our jobs. This is worth a more in-depth investigation, but for now, start thinking about how we can solve these issues: In addition to the above, I\\u2019m also concerned that formal education systems are not producing effective data scientists. With students trained specifically in data science, there may be many data scientists who can write a superb Jupyter Notebook, but have no idea how to put a machine learning model into production. There is an immense gap between getting a result once on a clean dataset in a Jupyter Notebook and running a model hundreds of times every day on real data with results served to clients. I don\\u2019t know if this gap can be bridged in a university setting by the current curriculums. As a final note, at Cortex, we have never been limited in what features we could build by data science \\u2014 the techniques themselves are simple to implement with open-source tools \\u2014 but rather by the intricacies required to get data, clean the data, format it currently, run the models and deliver those predictions (with explanations) to customers. My advice would be to spend some serious time learning software engineering and data engineering alongside traditional data science statistics and programming courses. Although the role of \\u201cdata scientist\\u201d might not last that long \\u2014 not because of automation but because of easier-to-use tools \\u2014 the skills learned in data science are only becoming more relevant. For better or worse, we live in a data-saturated, technology-driven world, and the capability to make sense of data and manipulate technology to do your bidding (instead of the other way round) is critical. If you are a current data scientist, keep applying those skills and learning new ones. For those studying to get into the field, recognize you are preparing not necessarily for the position of \\u201cdata scientist\\u201d, but rather for a world in which the skills of data science will become increasingly valued. I write articles on data science and occasionally other interesting topics. You can reach me on Twitter @koehrsen_will. If helping the environment and the bottom line appeals to you, then maybe reach out to us at Cortex. In the great talk \\u201cI Don\\u2019t Like Notebooks\\u201d (video and slides), Joel Grus lays out numerous criticisms of Jupyter Notebooks, perhaps the most popular environment for doing data science. I found the talk instructive \\u2014 when everyone thinks something is great, you need people who are willing to criticize it so we don\\u2019t become complacent. However, I think the problem isn\\u2019t the notebook itself, but how it\\u2019s used: like any other tool, the Jupyter Notebook can be (and is) frequently abused. Thus, I would like to amend Grus\\u2019 title and state \\u201cI Don\\u2019t Like Messy, Untitled, Out-of-Order Notebooks With No Explanations or Comments.\\u201d The Jupyter Notebook was designed for literate programming \\u2014 mixing code, text, results, figures, and explanations together into one seamless document. From what I\\u2019ve seen, this notion is often completely ignored resulting in awful notebooks flooding repositories on GitHub: The problems are clear: The Jupyter Notebook can be an incredibly useful device for learning, teaching, exploration, and communication (here is a good example). However, notebooks like the above fail on all these counts and it\\u2019s nearly impossible to debug someone else\\u2019s work or even figure out what they are trying to do when these problems appear. At the very least, anyone should be able to name a notebook something helpful, write a brief introduction, explanation, and conclusion, run the cells in order, and make sure there are no errors before posting the notebook to GitHub. Rather than just complaining about the problem (it\\u2019s easy to be a critic but a lot harder to do something positive) I decided to see what could be done with Jupyter Notebook extensions. The result is an extension that on opening a new notebook automatically: The benefits of this extension are that it changes the defaults. By default, the Jupyter Notebook has no markdown cells, is unnamed, and has no imports. We know that humans are notoriously bad at changing default settings so why not make the defaults encourage better practices? Think of the Setup extension as a nudge \\u2014 one that gently pushes you to write better notebooks. To use this extension: C:\\\\users\\\\willk\\\\anaconda3\\\\lib\\\\site-packages\\\\jupyter_contrib_nbextensions and on my mac (without anaconda) they are at: /usr/local/lib/python3.6/site-packages/jupyter_contrib_nbextensions 4. Place the setup folder in nbextensions/ under the above path: 5. Run jupyter contrib nbextensions install to install the new extension 6. Run a Jupyter Notebook and enableSetup on the nbextensions tab (if you don\\u2019t see this tab, open a notebook and go to edit > nbextensions config) Now open a new notebook and you\\u2019re good to go! You can change the default template in main.js (see my article on writing a Jupyter Notebook extension for more details on how to write your own). The default template and imports are relatively plain, but you can customize them to whatever you want. If you open an old notebook, you won\\u2019t get the default template, but you will be prompted to change the name from Untitled every time you run a cell: Sometimes, a little bit of persistence is what you need to change your ways. From now on, let\\u2019s strive to create better notebooks. It doesn\\u2019t take much extra effort and it pays off greatly as others (and your future self) will be able to learn from your notebooks or use the results to make better decisions. Here are a few simple rules for writing effective notebooks: The Setup extension will not solve all notebook-related problems, but hopefully, the small nudges will encourage you to adopt better habits. It takes a while to build up best practices, but, once you have them down, they tend to stick. With a little bit of extra effort, we can make sure that the next talk someone gives about notebooks is: \\u201cI like effective Jupyter Notebooks.\\u201d As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. The best things in life are free: friends, pandas, family, numpy , sleep, jupyter notebooks, laughing, and python. On a serious note, it\\u2019s pretty incredible that the best tools for data science are available at no cost and are created not by a company with unlimited resources, but by a community of individuals, most of whom work on these projects for no pay. You can shell out $860/year for Matlab (plus extra for more libraries) or you can download Python and any library for free, getting better software and great customer support (in the form of Stack Overflow and GitHub issues) without paying a cent. The free and open source software (FOSS) movement \\u2014 where you are free to use, share, copy, and improve upon software in any way \\u2014 has profoundly improved the digital tools used by companies and individuals while lowering the entry barriers to many fields (data science included ) to near zero. For those of us who grew up in the past few decades, this is the only model we know: of course software is free! However, the open-source tools we have come to depend on every day now face serious sustainability problems. In this article, we\\u2019ll look at the issues facing FOSS and, better yet, the many steps you can take (some in as few as 30 seconds) to ensure your favorite data science tools remain free and better than the paid alternatives. Although there is a real problem, there are also numerous solutions available to all of us. (This article relies on information from \\u201cRoads and Bridges: The Unseen Labor Behind Our Digital Infrastructure\\u201d as well as the NumFocus website.) Consider the amazing tool that is the Pandas library. As of February 20, 2019, Pandas has been downloaded over 80 million times from PyPi (details on analyzing PyPi downloads here). According to libraries.io, at least 25,000 GitHub repositories depend on Pandas and at least 100 different packages require the library. Nearly 1.8% of all questions on Stack Overflow are about Pandas (5x the number of questions about the entire Matlab language). The work of developing and maintaining Pandas is accomplished by a relatively small group. Since the project\\u2019s start by Wes McKinney in 2009, the Pandas repository has had only 1,400 contributors who have written a total of 294,000 lines of code according to openhub.net. This represents an astounding 78 developer years of effort, worth at least $7.8 million. Despite the value of their labor, almost every single one of those contributors worked entirely for free, driven by a desire to built great data science tooling. However, for Pandas to be maintained and updated, it needs more than part-time contributors. According to NumFocus (more on this organization later), Pandas requires 10 full-time paid developers to meet its goals, including working towards a version 1.0 release. Currently, this library, used by tens of millions of people and thousands of companies, has 1 core developer paid at 20% time, 1 paid at 10% time, and 8 paid at 0% time. Similar issues exist in other open-source data science libraries: matplotlib needs 14 full-time paid developers \\u2014 it currently has 2 at 10% paid time \\u2014 and numpy needs 12 \\u2014 it has 2 at 100% (thanks to a grant). This lack of paid developer time hurts open-source libraries: despite wide reliance in industry, Pandas is not yet at a 1.0 release (considered a stable version) and will only get there at a rate proportional to the level of funding it receives. The challenge of maintaining and improving a shared resource such as open-source software is expressed in the \\u201cTragedy of the Commons\\u201d: many people take advantage of no-cost tools, but few contribute back to them. Without proper support, the end result of the tragedy of the commons is a depletion of the resource and its eventual loss. Open-source software \\u2014 and not just in data science \\u2014 is increasingly running into sustainability issues as ever more individuals adopt these tools without giving back. Expanded adoption is great \\u2014 no one is arguing for closing off FOSS tools \\u2014 but it means the ratio of producers to consumers continues to fall to unsustainable levels. At the start of the open-source era, many of the users also helped to build the tools, but now, thanks to the incredible adoption of personal computers, many more people have access to this software, putting a strain on the tools that literally form our digital infrastructure. Over the past few years, we\\u2019ve started to see the crumbling of the open-source software that makes up our digital infrastructure (see the Roads and Bridges report). OpenSSL, a set of encryption tools used by 2/3 of all web servers, for years was supported by one full-time developer. The fact that 70% of the web relied on the work of one person didn\\u2019t motivate anyone or any companies to donate until 2014, when the \\u201cheartbleed\\u201d vulnerability was found, focusing attention on the project and leading to much-needed donations. Currently, OpenSSL has enough funding for 4 full-time employees for 3 years. Without another major issue though, the continuation of this funding is uncertain. As another example, bash, a Unix shell and command language installed on 70% of internet connected devices, (including every Linux and MacOS machine) has been maintained since 1992 by a single person, Chet Ramey, who works at Case Western Reserve University. Again, this didn\\u2019t seem to bother anyone until the \\u201cshellshock\\u201d vulnerability was discovered in bash in 2014, prompting much-needed media attention. Fortunately, as of this writing, we haven\\u2019t yet seen the equivalent issues in open-source data science tooling. Nonetheless, the time to act isn\\u2019t after a disaster has occurred, but as early as possible to head it off and prevent damage. If we want to avoid a true Tragedy of the Commons, then we need to take action to put our beloved tools on stable footing. It\\u2019s time to shift from mere consumers of open-source tools to supporters and/or producers! Anytime you present a problem, you should be legally obligated to also present a solution, ideally one that readers can immediately take. In the case of supporting open-source data science tools, there are plenty of options for you to help, no matter your technical expertise or financial status. Here, we\\u2019ll go through three: The first, and perhaps the easiest way to help, is reporting issues so project developers know what to fix. Linus\\u2019s Law says that \\u201cgiven enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\\u201d meaning that if a project has enough users, all the issues will eventually be found. Reporting issues is valuable, but it needs to be done in an effective manner. Make sure your issue has not already been solved (do a search for similar problems first), provide the exact code needed to reproduce the issue, and provide follow-up information as requested. Also, treat project developers with respect: open-source contributors have no obligation to fix all your problems so be nice and give them as much help as you can. If you are a little unsure about asking, here are some tips for submitting issues on GitHub, and here\\u2019s how to ask a good question on Stack Overflow. In addition to improving open-source libraries, both of these skills (submitting issues/asking questions) will help you personally as a data scientist because if you use a library long enough, you\\u2019ll eventually run into an issue no one else has had before. When you encounter new problems, you\\u2019ll have to know how to ask questions or how to solve them yourself. This point brings us to the second way to contribute: solving outstanding issues and needs of open-source libraries. GitHub is a wonderful platform for collaboration and it makes finding places you can contribute easy. All you need to do is go to your favorite library\\u2019s repository, select issues, and look for wherever you feel comfortable contributing. This doesn\\u2019t even require a high level of technical expertise. There are over 2800 open issues for pandas on GitHub, 227 of which are tagged \\u201cgood first issue\\u201d. Many of these issues have to do with documentation, which means you don\\u2019t need to write code! These contributions are a great place to get your feet wet working on open source and also build help you build a profile to show employers you\\u2019re committed to data science (please try not to just make token contributions for your profile \\u2014 make a commitment to a project). If neither of those options appeals to you, or you want to help out even more, you can provide financial support to open-source projects. Now, you may say my donation can never make a difference, but with the criminally small amounts most of these projects get, ($3000 for Pandas in 2017, $1300 for Numpy) even a minor donation can go a large way. Moreover, a lot of small donations from many individuals add up: if everyone reading my articles in a typical month gave just $1 month to open source, that would be over half a million dollars to support our data science tools! When it comes to giving donations, sometimes there can be too many options, so I\\u2019ll give you just one focused on data science, NumFocus. The stated goal of this charity is \\u201cprovide a stable, independent, and professional home for projects in the open source scientific data stack.\\u201d NumFocus gives support to open-source projects such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, project jupyter, ipython, pymc3 , pytables, and many others. Donating to NumFocus is simple: click the image and within 30 seconds you\\u2019ll be a sustaining member. Personally, I donate $2 a month to NumFocus. It\\u2019s a tiny amount \\u2014 in the universal measure of value, less than one cup of coffee a month \\u2014 but I enjoy knowing I\\u2019m doing a small part to help the libraries I love. Becoming a sustaining member is also great because I don\\u2019t even have to remember to donate \\u2014 I just sign up once, and automatically make my donation, each month getting a thank you email from NumFocus. In case data science isn\\u2019t your field, or you want to contribute to other projects, here are a few organizations that support open-source: (You can see a larger list here.) Again, I think it\\u2019s important to not get overwhelmed, so just pick one or two, automate your support, and then you don\\u2019t even have to think about it. If you want to go further, ask your company to become a sustaining member of open-source as well. If my experience is any indication, then your company will be glad to invest in these tools if you rely on them in your work. A few weeks ago, I ran into a strange bug in Pandas which I posted about on Stack Overflow and then GitHub, where it joined 2800 other open issues for Pandas. Shortly after, I received a comment directing me to the likely source of the issue, line 7400 in an 8000 line file forming the basis of dataframes in pandas and was told that a pull request would be welcome. Unfortunately, my technical skills and knowledge of pandas are nowhere near the level at which I want to go messing with the internals of the library. So, feeling like I needed to do something to help, I turned to the CTO of my company (Cortex Building Intel) and asked if the company would be willing to contribute monthly to NumFocus. Fortunately, our CTO realizes the value of supporting the technology we use every day and was happy to help out. I share this story not because I\\u2019m a paragon, but because it shows there are multiple ways to support open-source. When I was out of my technical league, I turned to another way to make a difference. I\\u2019m not naive enough to think my action alone will alleviate the issue, but if enough people act, we can improve the sustainability of these tools. Although it\\u2019s a little simplistic to think throwing money at problems will solve them, more paid developer time does help. Pandas has a list of goals to reach before version 1.0 is released and the only way these will get done in a timely manner is with funds to support paid developers. To make it more effective, put your message this way: supporting open-source tools is investing in the future of your company. Free and open-source technology has allowed many start-ups to get off the ground and now forms the technical core of numerous companies and even entire parts of the web. Donations now will ensure open-source continues to level the technical field, strengthen our infrastructure, and provide us with the best data science tools. Supporting open-source is about more than just having effective, free tools, it\\u2019s about being part of a larger community. The most powerful solution to the tragedy of the commons is fostering a sense of community. Make people feel like they belong to a shared group and they will work to ensure the resources are maintained for all members. When you start to make contributions, you feel a stronger sense of community (something severely lacking in our world) and know you are helping yourself and others. Also, if you do make a contribution of any type, you have my complete permission to boast about it on all your social media channels. There are some activities \\u2014 donating blood, volunteering at a food bank \\u2014 which are so inherently good for the world that I never get tired of seeing posts about them. When you donate to open source, shout it from the top of your personal mountain. If you donate more than me (yes this is a challenge), then let me know it and I\\u2019ll be glad to hear it. If someone calls you annoying, just shrug them off: you are making the world a better place and they are not. The open-source data science community will only keep growing, so let\\u2019s work to provide a sustainable foundation for the tools we all use. As a reminder, here\\u2019s the game plan: As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Here\\u2019s some good news: if you\\u2019ve spent hours studying a concept by reading books and class notes on the theory and you just can\\u2019t seem to get it, there\\u2019s a better way to learn. Starting with theory is always difficult and frustrating because you can\\u2019t see the most important part of a concept: how it\\u2019s used to solve problems. In contrast, learning by doing \\u2014 working through problems \\u2014 is more effective because it gives you context, letting you fit the technique into your existing mental framework. Moreover, studying through applications is more enjoyable for those motivated by an intrinsic desire to solve problems. In this article, we\\u2019ll apply the concepts of a Poisson Process and Poisson Distribution to model Earth asteroid impacts. We\\u2019ll build on the principles covered in The Poisson Process and Poisson Distribution Explained, putting into practice the ideas with real-world data. Through this project, we\\u2019ll get a sense of how to use statistical concepts to solve problems and how to compare the observed results with theoretical expected outcomes. The full code for this article (with interactive apps) can be run on mybinder.org by clicking the image. The Jupyter Notebook is on GitHub. We won\\u2019t cover the full details (see here) but these are the basics we need: The Poisson Process is a model for infrequent events \\u2014 like asteroid impacts \\u2014 where we know the average time between events but the actual time between any two events is randomly distributed (stochastic). Each event is independent of all other events, which means we can\\u2019t use the time since the last event to predict when the next event will occur. A Poisson model is an extension of a binomial model to situations where the number of expected successes is much less than the number of trials. Each sub-interval in a Poisson Process is a Bernoulli trial where the event either happens (success) or it does not. In our asteroid example, the event is an asteroid impact and the sub-interval is a year, so each year, an impact either happens or it does not (we\\u2019ll assume at most one impact per year and that impacts are independent). Asteroid strikes are \\u2014 thankfully \\u2014 infrequent, so the total number of successes is low compared to the number of years (trials) which we\\u2019ll consider. Moreover, we know the average time between impacts (we get this from data) but not when exactly the impacts will occur. To figure out the probability of a number of Poisson Process-generated events occurring in a time interval we use the Poisson Distribution with the Probability Mass Function (PMF): Where events/time is a frequency such as impacts/year. This formula is somewhat convoluted so we simplify (events / time) * time to a single parameter, \\u03bb. Lambda is the rate parameter of the distribution and is the only parameter we need to define the Poisson: Lambda is the expected (most likely) number of events in the time period. The probabilities of different numbers of events changes as we alter lambda: Finally, the distribution of time between events (waiting time) is a decaying exponential. The probability of waiting longer than t between events is: Waiting times in a Poisson Process are memoryless, meaning they have no dependence on each other. The average waiting time between events works out to be 1 / frequency. The Poisson distribution is fairly simple to wrap your head around as it requires only a single parameter, the rate parameter which is the expected number of events in the interval, or freq * time. To use the Poisson Process and Distribution for asteroid impacts, all we need is the average frequency of asteroid impacts. The bad news is that there is not enough data to pin down the rates precisely. The good news is that scientists have come up with some estimates based on the data we do have (such as the number of Near Earth Asteroids) and robust simulations. We\\u2019ll use data in the NASA 2017 Report of the Near Earth Object Science Definition Team which, among tons of fascinating information, provides estimates of the frequency of asteroid impacts for different sized asteroids. Once we\\u2019ve loaded the data and cleaned up the columns, we have this data: Each row is a different sized asteroid (with averagediameter in km) and the critical column is the impact_frequency. This gives the average number of impacts per year which we can convert into a time_between_impacts by taking the reciprocal. The impact_frequency decreases with increasing size because there are fewer large asteroids (specified by number). Although it\\u2019s not necessary, I like to start out with data analysis like looking at the impact energy by diameter or the time between impacts by diameter: Notice that both graphs are on a log scale and the impact energy is in terms of Megatons Equivalent of TNT. As a point of comparison, the largest human bomb was about 100 Megatons while the largest asteroids are 10 Million Megatons (there are only 2 of these in Earth\\u2019s vicinity). From the time between impacts graph, the frequency of impacts decreases rapidly as the size of the asteroids increases to more than 100 million years between impacts. To explore the data, there\\u2019s an interactive exploration tool in the notebook. Based on the data exploration, we should expect fewer impacts from the larger asteroids because they have a lower impact frequency. If our modeling results don\\u2019t line up with this conclusion, something is probably not right! Our objective is to determine the probability distribution of the number of expected impacts in each size category which means we need a time range. To keep things in perspective, we\\u2019ll start with 100 years, about the lifespan of a human. This means our distribution will show the probabities for number of impacts over a human life. Because we are using a probabilistic model, we run multiple trials and then derive distributions of outcomes rather than use one number. For a large sample, we\\u2019ll simulate one lifetime 10,000 times. Simulating a Poisson distribution is simple to do in Python using the np.random.poisson function which generates a number of events according to the Poisson distribution with a given rate parameter, lam. To run 10,000 trials, we set that assize. Here is the code for running the simulation with the impact frequency for the smallest asteroid category. The results are best visualized in a histogram: We see that over 10,000 simulated lifetimes, the most common number of impacts is 0. This is as expected given the value of the rate parameter (which is the most likely outcome): (Since the Poisson Distribution is only defined at discrete number of events, we should round this to the nearest integer). To compare the simulated results to those expected from theory, we calculate the theoretical probability of each number of impacts using the Poisson Probability Mass Function and the rate parameter: (We\\u2019re using fractional events to get a smooth curve.) We then plot this on top of the bars (after normalizing to get a probability): It\\u2019s nice when the observed (in this case simulated) results line up with theory! We can extend our analysis to all sizes of asteroids using the same poisson function and vectorized numpy operations: This gives us 10,000 simulations of one lifetime for each of the 27 sizes of asteroids. To visualize this data, we\\u2019ll plot the average number of impacts for each size range along with the expected number of impacts (rate parameter). Again, the results line up with theory. For most of the asteroid sizes, there is only a minuscule chance of observing one impact in a lifetime. For another visualization, we can plot the Poisson PMF for all asteroid sizes: The most likely number of impacts is 0 for all sizes over 100 years. For those of us alive in 2013, we already had one asteroid event (although not an impact) when a near Earth asteroid 20 m (0.02 km the units used here) in diameter exploded over the Chelyabinsk oblast in Russia. However, because the Poisson process waiting times are memoryless, it is false to conclude there is a lower chance of seeing another asteroid strike now because there was one recently. In order to see more impacts, we can run the simulation over a longer period of time. Since the genus Homo (our genus) has been around for 2 million years, let\\u2019s run 10,000 simulations of 2 million years to see the expected number of asteroid impacts. All we have to do is alter the number of years which in turn affects the rate parameter. Plotting the average number of impacts simulated and theoretical, this time on a log scale, gives us the following: Now we observe many more impacts which makes sense because we are considering a much longer time period. The Poisson PMF for all asteroid sizes over 2 million years is: Again, the expected (average) number of impacts will be the rate parameter, \\u03bb, for each asteroid size. For the longer simulation, we do observe impacts for the larger asteroid sizes. Remember, the Chelyabinsk meteor that exploded over Russia was 20 meters in diameter (0.020 km). We are talking some massive asteroids in this graph. Another way we can use the Poisson Process model is to calculate the time between events. The probability of the time between events exceeding t is given by the following equation: Calculating the theoretical values is as simple as: The relationship follows a decaying exponential: To simulate waiting times using the actual data, we can model 100 million years as individual Bernoulli trials (either an impact or not). The probability of success in each year is just the frequency. The waiting time is then the difference in years between impacts (working with the smallest asteroids): Plotting this as a histogram yields the following: To make sure the observed data lines up with the theoretical, we can plot the two on top of each other (after normalizing and binning): As a final plot, we can look at the average time between impacts over all asteroid sizes both observed (simulated) and theoretical: Even over 100 million years, there were no impacts for the largest asteroids (or only one which means we can\\u2019t calculate a waiting time). This makes sense because the expected time between impacts is over 100 million years! The final part in the notebook is an interactive analysis where you can play with the parameters to observe the effects. You can change the length of time to run the simulation, the diameter to inspect, and the number of trials. I encourage you to run the analysis for yourself to see how the parameters change the results by going to the Jupyer Notebook on mybinder.org here. Many times in school I had the experience of thinking my understanding of a topic was complete in class only to open up the homework and have no idea where to start. This theory-application mismatch was bad enough on the homework and was even larger when it came to real world problems. It wasn\\u2019t until my final two years of college when I started learning through doing problems that my ability to apply concepts (and just as importantly my joy in learning) developed. Although the theory is still important (I usually go back to study the concepts after I\\u2019ve seen them in use), it can be hard to master a concept only by digging through rigorous derivations. In this article, we saw how to apply statistical concepts \\u2014 the Poisson Process Model and Poisson Distribution \\u2014 to a real-world situation. Although asteroids probably will not impact our daily lives this project shows a potential use of methods we can apply to other similar problems. Data science requires constantly expanding one\\u2019s skill set because of how varied the problems are. Whenever we learn a new technique we become more effective, and if we can enjoy the process by applying a concept to novel data, so much the better. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. There ought to be a law limiting people to one use of the term \\u201clife-changing\\u201d to describe a life event. Had a life-changing cup of coffee this morning? Well, hope it was good because that\\u2019s the one use you get! If this legislation came to pass, then I would use my allotment on my decision to write about data science. This writing has led directly to 2 data science jobs, altered my career plans, moved me across the country, and ultimately made me more satisfied than when I was a miserable mechanical engineering university student. In 2018, I made a commitment to write on data science and published at least one article per week for a total of 98 posts. It was a year of change for me: a college graduation, 4 jobs, 5 different cities, but the one constant was data science writing. As a culture, we are obsessed by streaks and convinced those who complete them must have gained profound knowledge. Unlike other infatuations, this one may make sense: to do something consistently for an extended period of time, whether that is coding, writing, or staying married, requires impressive commitment. Doing a new thing is easy because our brains crave novelty, but doing the same task over and over once the newness has worn off requires a different level of devotion. Now, to continue the grand tradition of streak completers writing about the wisdom they gained, I\\u2019ll describe the lessons learned in \\u201cThe Year of Data Science Writing.\\u201d The five takeaways from a year of weekly data science writing are: Each of the takeaways is accompanied by a graph of my Medium article stats. You can find the Jupyter Notebook here or get your own stats with this article. Mechanical engineering, which I unfortunately studied in college, has to be taught at an institution. It\\u2019s just not possible for an individual (at least one with normal resources) to gather the equipment\\u2014 labs, prototyping machines, wind tunnels, manufacturing shop \\u2014 needed for a \\u201cmech-e\\u201d education. Fortunately, data science is not similarly constrained: no topic in the field, no matter how state-of-the-art, is off-limits to anyone in the world with an Internet connection and a willingness to learn. While I did take a few useful stats classes in college (note: everything in these classes is covered by the free Introduction to Statistical Learning) the data science courses at my college were woefully out-of-date. We were taught tools and techniques that fell out of favor years ago. In several cases, I showed the professor evidence of this only to be told: \\u201cwell I\\u2019m going to teach what I know because it worked for me.\\u201d What\\u2019s more, these classes were geared toward research which means writing inefficient, messy code that runs once to get results for a paper. Nothing was ever mentioned about writing code for production: things like unit tests, reusable functions, or even code standards. Instead of relying on college classes, I taught myself (and continue learning) data science/machine learning from books and online courses/articles. I select resources that teach by example and focus on what is actually used in data science in practice today. (By these standards, the best classes are from Udacity and the best book is Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow by Aurelien Geron.) You don\\u2019t have to pay for material: fast.ai has the most cutting-edge course available on deep learning for free; Kaggle gives you opportunities to work on real-world data and learn from thousands of data scientists; and, books like The Python Data Science Handbook don\\u2019t cost anything! (Towards Data Science is also useful). Initially, I wasn\\u2019t sure these resources were enough to be successful in data science, but after getting into the field, I found they were more than enough. Few people know what they are talking about when it comes to data science, and if you\\u2019ve studied the most recent material available online, you\\u2019ll be ahead of most everyone else. In fact, I would argue you are better off learning from online sources/courses, which are constantly updated, than from educational institutions that revise curriculum at most once per year. All this is not to say that learning data science is simple: you still need willpower and perseverance to study day after day (see more on consistency in 3.). That being said, I find it easier to stay motivated and understand concepts when using material which teaches through hands-on examples. Rather than study the theory first and then look at applications, I use what Jeremy Howard at fast.ai calls the top-down approach: start off with an implementation of the concept that solves a problem, preferably in code. Then, with a framework in place, go back and study the theory as needed. Finally, I learned to not let data science/machine learning vocab intimidate you. The hardest part of breaking into the field may be learning the terms as it\\u2019s difficult to get your bearings when people use words you\\u2019ve never heard. Don\\u2019t be afraid to ask for clarification on a word you don\\u2019t know and, once you do know the meaning of a long word, don\\u2019t use it only to sound smart. You\\u2019ll sound smarter and be more helpful if you use easy to understand language. (If you need some help, here\\u2019s a useful machine learning glossary). If you look at my articles in 2018, one pattern immediately stands out: there is no pattern! The articles lurch from one topic \\u2014 random forests in Python \\u2014 to another \\u2014 Bayesian regression \\u2014 to a third \\u2014 Goodhart\\u2019s Law \\u2014 to a fourth \\u2014 Recurrent Neural Networks\\u2014 with no trend. This is a direct outcome of my insatiable curiosity: if I hear something odd in a footnote of an audiobook, read an obscure reference paper, or see a strange tweet, I have to get my hands on some data, write some code, and do some analysis. This can be a blessing or a curse, but fortunately, data science is a good field in which to be curious: Data science rewards curiosity: you must be willing to explore new methods and techniques in order to stay relevant as the field evolves. Furthermore, being curious about new tools helps you avoid becoming dependent on one library, a lesson I learned the hard way. I spent far too long using matplotlib because of the hours I\\u2019d sunk learning it before I switched to plotly. Within 30 minutes, I was as proficient as I\\u2019d been with 50 hours of studying matplotlib indicating I should have made the change much sooner! This balance between finding new tools or using the ones you already know has a formalization in the explore-exploit problem. You can spend time exploiting \\u2014 using what you already know \\u2014 or exploring \\u2014 searching for a new method which might be better than the current one. Curiosity is also helpful when you\\u2019re actually doing data science: exploratory data analysis is driven by the goal of finding interesting patterns in the data. On a somewhat related tangent, Richard Feynman, arguably the smartest man of the 20th century, might be the best proponent for the benefits of a curious mindset. A theoretical physicist, he was as well known for picking up skills (like safe-cracking) or playing practical jokes as he is for his work on quantum mechanics. According to his works, this curiosity was integral to his work as a scientist and made his life more enjoyable. Feynman was driven not by a desire for glory or wealth, but because he genuinely wanted to figure things out! This is the same attitude I adopt in my data science projects: I\\u2019m doing these projects not because they are a required chore, but because I want to find answers to hard problems hidden within data. This curiosity-based attitude also makes my job enjoyable: every time I get to do some data analysis, I approach it as a satisfying task. The 98 articles I published in 2018 totaled 264,894 words. For every word published, there was at least 1 word that didn\\u2019t make it through editing. This works out to about 530,000 words or 1,500 words per day. The only way this was possible studying and working full-time was to make sure I wrote and made progress on my projects every single day. My view is simple: the hardest part of any endeavor is beginning, so once you\\u2019ve gotten past that, why stop? The best analogy for the payoff of writing/working consistently is making regular contributions to a savings account. On a day-to-day basis, you don\\u2019t notice much change, but then one day you wake up and your initial investment has tripled (or you\\u2019ve written 100 data science articles). It can be difficult to see the benefits if you look only at the progress from yesterday to today, but if you can take a step back and view the long term then you see the value of making a little progress every day. On a practical basis, you don\\u2019t need to write 1500 words per day. I had to make sacrifices to get to that point (I average about 20 hours per week working on articles \\u2014 unpaid so thanks for the encouragement). Aim for whatever you can, whether that is 300 words, or writing a few lines of code. The key is that you create a frame of mind where writing, or working on side projects, is not an extra hassle, but a part of every day. Moreover, writing doesn\\u2019t have to be on Medium, or even for a blog post. All writing (even tweets) helps you improve. Start by writing more in your Jupyter Notebooks. The notebook environment is a great tool for data science but is abused (look at this presentation) when people forget its intended purpose, literate programming. Literate programming, as laid out by Donald Knuth, means mixing text, code, and output in the same document, following the natural progress of turning thoughts into code which produces a result. Writing is hard, but it\\u2019s a rewarding activity. As a good rule, the things in life that are most difficult \\u2014 exercise, education, writing \\u2014 are also those which deliver the greatest long-term benefits. Moreover, all of these endeavors improve with regular practice. Start making regular contributions in your free time now and your future self will thank you for your foresight. What is the optimal number of trees in a random forest? How many rounds of boosting should you run a gradient boosting machine? Which optimizer is the best for your convolutional neural network? What is the most effective dimension reduction technique for highly correlated features? The answer to all of these questions is the same: you\\u2019ll have to experiment and find out for yourself. There are still few hard and fast rules to always follow in data science and even fewer explanations for why things work so well. This means that data science/machine learning is nearly entirely empirical: results are generated not working from theory but through experimentation. This lack of accepted solutions can be frustrating. How am I supposed to set the hyperparameters of my random forest? At the same time, it can also be enabling: there are no \\u201cright\\u201d answers which is great for tinkerers who like to experiment. At the very least, you need to be prepared to ask a question only to be told you\\u2019ll just have to write the code and find out for yourself. (As a note, I think it\\u2019s worth separating best practices \\u2014 things like code reviews and following pep8 for code style \\u2014 from the best methods for tasks like regression or dimensionality reduction. There are best practices to follow but the methods are still being sorted out.) A good approach to data science is to view yourself as a perpetual beginner. Knowing a lot is better than not knowing much, but it can also be constraining. You can\\u2019t see past the methods you\\u2019ve always used to the better option that was just invented (remember explore/exploit?). Accept that you\\u2019ll never reach \\u201cthe end of data science knowledge\\u201d and be willing to try out new techniques even if no one else is. Also, when someone tells you there is only one right way to do something in machine learning, be very skeptical. Data science is still a level field where the experts aren\\u2019t necessarily the ones best equipped to solve a particular problem; if you think someone (especially me) is doing some project suboptimally, point it out! Mutualism is a form of symbiosis in which both organisms benefit from a relationship. Our gut bacteria is a perfect example: it gets to feed off our digestive products while we enjoy health benefits. To tie this back to data science, writing is also a symbiotic relationship because both the writer and the readers come out ahead. When I finish an article about data science, I never know if the greater benefit accrues to me or those who read the post. Writing is literally thinking. It forces you to sort out your thoughts, and explaining concepts to someone else \\u2014 especially with simple language \\u2014 requires deep understanding. Writing drives me not only to study more so I know what I\\u2019m writing about, but it also lets me form simple explanations that I can use at my job to explain concepts to a wide (non-technical) audience. The other way I\\u2019ve benefitted from writing (besides earning two jobs) is being part of a larger community. Writing and seeing other people benefit from my articles gives me a greater sense of fulfillment than anything I do on a day-to-day basis. Not to get too sentimental, but being a \\u201cwriter\\u201d is as much a part of my self-definition as anything now and it gives me the motivation to get up early on the weekends and write to contribute to the community. On the other side of the relationship, I certainly hope people are better off from this writing. In my transition into data science, I received tons of help from the community, and writing is my small way of paying it forward. Further, my articles are free to read because I believe everyone in a field benefits when knowledge is allowed to spread without barriers. Beyond free knowledge, the field of data science will be better off when more diverse people are attracted to it. A field benefits as it diversifies because of the new ways of approaching and working through problems different individuals bring (this doesn\\u2019t just sound good, it\\u2019s been proven). Data science is a great field, and I don\\u2019t want to see it crippled by homogeneity. If my articles can help expand data science to a wider audience then the entire community will be richer. To wrap, these are the takeaways from \\u201cThe Year of Data Science Writing\\u201d While there are plenty of other things I could be doing with my time, it\\u2019s hard to imagine anything else that would deliver as many benefits both to myself and to others as the act of writing about data science. Although I\\u2019ve branched out into data journalism this year (to become less wrong about the world with data), I\\u2019ll continue writing about standard data science: projects, tools, and techniques you might find useful. As a final point, consider this: writing is one of a few activities in our lives over which we have complete control. Start from a blank page, over days or weeks put your thoughts onto the page, and, eventually, you\\u2019ll have a work created entirely from your own mind that can travel around the world to millions of people in seconds potentially improve your life and theirs. That is the definition of magic \\u2014 now go out and practice data science writing. As always I welcome constructive criticism and feedback. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. There are few actions less efficient in data exploration than re-running the same cell over and over again, each time slightly changing the input parameters. Despite knowing this, I still find myself repeatedly executing cells just to make the slightest change, for example, choosing a different value for a function, selecting various date ranges for analysis, or even adjusting the theme of a plotly visualization. Not only is this inefficient, but it\\u2019s also frustrating, disrupting the flow of an exploratory data analysis. The ideal solution to this issue would be interactive controls to change inputs without needing to rewrite or rerun code. Fortunately, as is often the case in Python, someone has already run into this problem and developed a great tool to solve it. In this article, we\\u2019ll see how to get started with IPython widgets ( ipywidgets), interactive controls you can build with one line of code. This library allows us to turn Jupyter Notebooks from static documents into interactive dashboards, perfect for exploring and visualizing data. You can view a completely interactive running notebook with the widgets in this article on mybinder by clicking the image below. IPython widgets, unfortunately, do not render on GitHub or nbviewer but you can still access the notebook and run locally. The first step, as usual, is installing the library: pip install ipywidgets . Once that finishes, you can activate widgets for Jupyter Notebook with To use with JupyterLab, run: To import the ipywidgetslibrary in a notebook, run Let\\u2019s say we have the following dataframe with Medium article statistics (these are my actual stats, you can see how to get them in this article): How can we view all articles with more than 1000 reads? Here\\u2019s one way: But if we want to show articles with more than 500 claps, we have to write another line of code: Wouldn\\u2019t it be nice if we could just rapidly change these parameters \\u2014 both the column and threshold \\u2014 without writing more code? Try this: With the @interact decorator, the IPywidgets library automatically gives us a text box and a slider for choosing a column and number! It looks at the inputs to our function and creates interactive controls based on the types. Now we can segment the data using the controls (widgets) without writing code. You may have noticed some problems with the widgets \\u2014 x can go negative and we had to type in the correct column name. We can fix these by providing specific arguments to the function parameters: Now we get a dropdown for the column (with the options in the list) and an integer slider limited to a range (the format is (start, stop, step) ). Read through the documentation for the full details of how function parameters are mapped to widgets. We can use this same @interact decorator to quickly turn any ordinary function into an interactive widget. For example, we may have a lot of images in a directory we want to quickly look through: Now we can quickly cycle through all the images without re-running the cell. This might actually be useful if you were building a convolutional neural network and wanted to examine the images your network had missclassified. The uses of widgets for data exploration are boundless. Another simple example is finding correlations between two columns: There are numerous helpful examples on the ipywidgets GitHub. Interactive widgets are especially helpful for selecting data to plot. We can use the same @interact decorator with functions that visualize our data: Here we are using the amazing cufflinks+plotly combination to make an interactive plot with interactive IPython widget controls. You may have noticed the plot was a little slow to update. If that is the case, we can use @interact_manual which requires a button for updating. Now the plot will only be updated when the button is pressed. This is useful for functions that take a while to return an output. To get more from the IPywidgets library, we can make the widgets ourselves and use them int the interact function. One of my favorite widgets is the DatePicker. Say we have a function, stats_for_article_published_between, that takes a start and end date and prints stats for all the articles published between them. We can make this interactive using the following code Now we get two interactive date selection widgets and the values are passed into the function (see notebook for details): Similarly, we can make a function that plots the cumulative total of a column up until a date using the same DataPicker interactive widget. If we want to make the options for one widget dependent on the value of another, we use the observe function. Here, we alter the image browser function to choose both the directory and image. The list of images displayed is updated based on the directory we select. When we want to reuse widgets across cells, we just need to assign them to the output of theinteract function. Now, to reuse the stats widget, we can just call stats.widget in a cell. This lets us reuse our widgets across a notebook. As a note, the widgets are tied to one another meaning the value in one cell will be automatically updated to the value you select for the same widget in another cell. We haven\\u2019t gotten close to covering all the capabilities of IPywidgets. For instance, we can link values together, create custom widgets, make buttons, build animations, create a dashboard with tabs, and so on. Take a look at the documentation for further uses. Even with the small amount covered here, I hope you see how interactive controls can enhance a notebook workflow! The Jupyter Notebook is a great data exploration and analysis environment. However, by itself, it doesn\\u2019t offer the best functionality. Using tools like notebooks extensions and interactive widgets make the notebook come to life and make our jobs as data scientists more efficient. Furthermore, building widgets and using them in a notebook is simply fun! Writing lots of code to do the same task repeatedly is not enjoyable, but using interactive controls creates a more natural flow for our data explorations and analyses. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Of all the myths spread by the media, perhaps none is more detrimental than Us vs Them: the idea that the world is divided into two groups \\u2014 one good, one evil \\u2014 and all events can be viewed as a struggle between the two. This two-sided view of the world takes advantage of our natural tendency to form tribes and is applied in many situations, from political parties to economic systems, and, to countries in the form of \\u201cdeveloped vs. developing world.\\u201d In the last case, this takes the form: developed = rich with low birth rates (assumed to be us) vs. developing = poor with high birth rates (them). A binary outlook may make for compelling news (conflicts and tribalism are sure ways to get our attention) but it\\u2019s false. All of human life, from the personal \\u2014 income, height, sexuality \\u2014 to the international \\u2014 systems of government, economic systems, national wealth \\u2014 exists not in two states, but along a continuum. Moreover, we dehumanize people by splitting them into two groups letting our instincts and cognitive biases do the thinking for us instead of using our rationality. In this article, the fourth episode of the Reality Project \\u2014 an effort dedicated to becoming less wrong about the world with data \\u2014 we\\u2019ll see why a separation between developing and developed countries no longer applies and look at factful ways to view nations instead. The previous episode of The Reality Project, on global nuclear weapons is here. You can find all The Reality Project by searching on Medium for the tag. For this article, we\\u2019ll rely primarily on Hans Rosling\\u2019s book: Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\\u2019re Wrong About the World. Other sources are the World Bank Poverty Page, the YouTube video \\u201cDebunking Third World Myths with the Best Stats You\\u2019ve Never Seen\\u201d, and the article \\u201cShould We Continue to Use the Term \\u2018Developing World\\u2019?\\u201d. I made the graphs with the Gapminder Data Exploration tool which you can download for free (it includes data). To start, it\\u2019s worth looking at where this binary idea applied to countries originated. The term \\u201cdeveloping country\\u201d probably evolved out of \\u201cThird World\\u201d, which originally referred to countries aligned with neither the Communist Soviet bloc or Capitalist NATO in the 1950s. These countries tended to be former colonies struggling to provide citizens with a decent standard of living, and \\u201cThird World\\u201d soon came to mean poor countries with high birth rates, what are now referred to as developing nations. Admittedly, at one point, during the 1960s, this distinction actually did make sense \\u2014 or at least was in line with the existing data. In the below chart, we see the fertility rate (births per woman) on the y-axis versus income (GDP per capita) on the x-axis in 1960 for all countries where we have data. (The color represents the world region: yellow = Europe, blue = Africa, green = Americas, and Red = Asia + Australia). There is a relatively clear grouping as countries in Europe plus a few in the Americas and Asia tended to be both richer and have fewer babies per woman (lower right). On the other hand, African countries almost exclusively had high birth rates and low income. Development aid took off in the post-WWII years, and so, at the time, this classification allowed NGOs and governments to focus their efforts. However, since 1960, the picture of the world has changed dramatically. Let\\u2019s look at the same graph in 1990, just after the fall of the Soviet Union. Now we see not a grouping but a linear transition. There are still differences between countries, but the noticeable gap that existed has given way to a smooth line. The global fertility rate, at an extremely high 5 babies per woman in 1960, had fallen to 3 in 1990. The extreme poverty rate \\u2014 less than $2 /day \\u2014 likewise fell, from over 60% in 1960 to less than 40% in 1990. These trends \\u2014 decreasing fertility and decreasing poverty \\u2014 have only accelerated since 1990. Below is the most up-to-date picture of the world: What we see here has been named \\u201cThe Great Convergence.\\u201d While there are still differences, there is no one gap that divides countries; instead, they are arrayed along a continuous line of income. Drawing a single separating line of this graph is impossible because there is only a smooth transition. Countries all over the world have gotten richer and, as a result, have longer lives, reduced childhood mortality, and fewer children per women. Notably, China and India (visible as the large red bubbles) have experienced extreme reductions in poverty, resulting in a new world low of under 9% extreme poverty in 2018. The new global birth rate is at 2.5 babies per woman, drawing near to the replacement rate of 2.1. When we look at a similar graph of childhood survival versus fertility rate, we can see the same trend. The developing/developed gap here is even clearer in 1960 (left) but again, the world has since converged (right). The old boxes clearly no longer fit. We\\u2019ll get into a more accurate characteristic in the next section. We\\u2019ll end this part with one final visual: the changing worldwide income distribution since 1800. It\\u2019s one thing to get your picture of the world from the news, but completely different to watch the transformations take place in front of your eyes with real data. As incomes around the world increase, the global extreme poverty rate (vertical line) decreases from 86% to under 15%(and, in 2018, the World Bank reported it was under 10%). If you watch closely, you can see the emergence of a gap right around 1960 \\u2014 this is precisely the time at which the terms \\u201cdeveloping\\u201d and \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d first came into use. However, as the animation continues, the gap slowly disappears until incomes exist along a continuous distribution. The separation of incomes \\u2014 called the Great Divergence \\u2014 was a real phenomenon, but the new picture is a Great Convergence as incomes increase nearly everywhere. This disappearing of the \\u201cgap\\u201d between two distinct sets of countries means the terms \\u201cdeveloping\\u201d and \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d no longer accurately represent countries. If we use this distinction, it means placing Mexico, GDP per capita $17,000, and Mozambique, GDP per capita $1,200, in the same category. In other words, a binary distinction is too broad. Nonetheless, as in the 1960s, some form of breaking up countries is useful as it allows us to find countries with similar needs. If the two-part model is broken, what fixes it? In Factfulness, Hans Rosling lays out a four-tiered approach for grouping countries based on similar needs derived from income. These are outlined as follows (from Bill Gates\\u2019 excellent post on the subject). If you must think of it this way, Level One is \\u201clower-class\\u201d, Levels Two and Three are the global \\u201cmiddle-class\\u201d, and Level Four is the \\u201cupper-class\\u201d. In this system, the vast majority of the world\\u2019s population are correctly classified as middle class or above reflecting the recent substantial gains in income. Below is a breakdown of the world population into each level over time: In 1800, close to the entire world population (85%) existed on Level One. In 2018, only 15% of the world\\u2019s population is still there and the middle classes are growing far faster than the extremes. The actual levels and dollar amounts, with each person representing approximately 1 billion people, are below: The four-tier system is an improvement over a binary split. Rosling\\u2019s approach is useful because it captures needs of different countries more accurately than binary categories, it allows us to clearly see progress over time, and it prevents us from falling into the Us vs. Them type of thinking. (Not to mention the numbers work out very well). While this argument may seem like semantics, it actually does matter because how we measure determines how we act. (There are other systems to approach the same problem. The International Monetary Fund still uses a binary advanced vs emerging economies, the United Nations Development Program uses a continuous Human Development Index, and the World Bank has recently stopped using the terms \\u201cdeveloping\\u201d and \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d. There is also a compelling argument for expanding the four categories to five with the fifth representing abundance.) Why does any measurement matter? The answer: it helps us to figure out what approaches work to solve a problem by observing causes and effects. Consider a typical continuous human measurement, weight. If you are trying to lose weight, one of the best places to start is simply weigh yourself every day so you can see if you are going in the right direction. How else are you supposed to know if your (non)-interventions are having any impact? A process of act \\u2014 measure results \\u2014 adjust actions is how we personally improve in any pursuit. The exact same is true of global development: measuring along a continuous or four-tier scale allows us to clearly see progress over time and relate back specific improvements to causes. The weight metaphor also holds up when we start to think about using binary versus multiple categories. If there are only two states \\u2014 fat and thin \\u2014 we are inaccurate categorizing a lot of people and it\\u2019s going to be hard to stay motivated if your status never changes even from year-to-year. We are much better off thinking in terms of categories \\u2014 obese, overweight, healthy, underweight \\u2014 so we can make salient recommendations to individuals (or ourselves) to guide their actions for losing weight. When it comes to global poverty, it can seem like there are reasons to despair. There are 750 million people \\u2014 mostly in Sub-Saharan Africa \\u2014 currently in extreme poverty. However, we shouldn\\u2019t stop there, and, once we start digging into the data, the picture becomes much better: over 1.2 billion people lifted out of extreme poverty in the past 30 years and the real possibility of eliminating extreme poverty within the next several decades. With a binary worldview, we risk missing all of that by lumping together everyone not at our income level as developing. In the four-tier framework, we can see that actually about 85% (6/7 billion) people live on the second level or higher and the largest segment of the population lives in the global middle class (levels 2 and 3). If we look again at the graph of the distribution of levels over time, we see lots of reason for hope: The middle classes are growing and the first level (the \\u201clower class\\u201d) is shrinking rapidly. This is good not only for people in those countries but also for everyone around the world. As countries get wealthier, citizens report increased life satisfaction (a better measure than day-to-day happiness): Furthermore, as incomes increase, fertility rates decrease as better health care leads to fewer children dying and subsequently, women have fewer babies: (There are many other reasons for the decline in fertility which you can read about on the Our World in Data fertility page.) There are people worried about overpopulation (I don\\u2019t happen to be one of them based on the data and best estimates) and, if you are one of them, the best way to limit population growth is to bring people in all countries out of poverty. As families have fewer children, they can spend more resources on each child, giving them a better chance to succeed, which they can then pass on to their children and the virtuous cycle of decreasing poverty and decreasing fertility continues. You might argue that at the end of the day, this is only semantics. However, the \\u201cdeveloped vs developing\\u201d dichotomy is more than a choice of words, it\\u2019s a mindset. At its core, a binary worldview is intellectually lazy because it means not looking at the data and it\\u2019s inhumane because it leads us to see individuals as the dreaded other rather than as people fighting for the same things that we are \\u2014 health, prosperity, and a better life for those in the next generation. The Reality Project isn\\u2019t about knowing facts so you can feel superior, it\\u2019s about using facts to encourage people to contribute to the long ascent of humankind. The \\u201cDeveloped vs Developing\\u201d myth is a great place to start because it offers an opportunity to show optimistic stats, talk about how our view of the world is wrong, and make gentle corrections. Once we understand why and how the world is getting better, we can make sure it continues that way. As a first step, start by viewing matters \\u2014 in your personal life and on an international level \\u2014 not as black and white but on a scale, that, even when divided, shows progress and its causes. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Contrary to what some of data scientists may like to believe, we can never reduce the world to mere numbers and algorithms. When it comes down to it, decisions are made by humans, and being an effective data scientist means understanding both people and data. Consider the following real-life example: When OPower, a software company, wanted to get people to use less energy, they provided customers with plenty of stats about their electricity usage and cost. However, the data alone were not enough to get people to change. In addition, OPower needed to take advantage of behavioral science, namely, studies showing people were driven to reduce energy when they received smiley emoticons on their bills showing how they compare to their neighbors! The simple intervention of putting a \\ud83d\\ude03 on people\\u2019s electricity bills when they used less than their neighbors, and a \\ud83d\\ude26 face when they could do better ended up reducing electricity consumption 2\\u20133%, in the process saving millions of dollars and preventing emissions of millions of pounds of CO2 \\ud83c\\udfc6! To a data scientist, this may be a shock \\u2014 you mean people don\\u2019t respond to pure data !\\u2014 but this was no surprise to the chief science officer of OPower, Robert Cialdini, a former psychology professor who wrote a book about the human behavior. The takeaway is you can have any data you want but you still need an understanding of how humans work to effect real change. In our daily work and formal education as data scientists, it\\u2019s difficult to get a glimpse into the workings of humans or to take a step back and think about the social implications of our work. Therefore, it\\u2019s critical to read not only technical articles and textbooks but also to branch out into works that look at how people make choices and how data can be used to improve these choices. In this article, I\\u2019ll highlight 6 books that are non-technical \\u2014 in the sense that they don\\u2019t delve into the math and algorithms \\u2014 but critical reads for data scientists. These books are necessary for anyone who wants to accomplish the objective of data science: enable better real-world decisions through data. The 6 books are listed here with brief reviews and takeaways following: Predictions about the future \\u2014 in areas like elections, economics, national politics, and tech advances \\u2014 are often hilariously wrong. These forecasts are less humorful when they have actual real-world consequences, and in this work, Silver explains why people tend to be terrible at making predictions and examines the few who have managed to break the trend in a number of different fields. It turns out there is no one magic rule for being right about the future, just a handle of basic rules practiced by great predictors. Anyone can benefit from the simple advice offered throughout the book: Two great additional books in this same category are Superforecasting and Expert Political Judgement both by Philip Tetlock. 2. Weapons of Math Destruction: How Big Data Increases Inequality and Threatens Democracy by Cathy O\\u2019Neill Weapons of Math Destruction should be mandatory reading for students pursuing a degree in stats, machine learning, or data science, and for anyone who will have to make the decision to deploy a model. A \\u201cweapon of math destruction\\u201d is any algorithm that is opaque \\u2014 can\\u2019t be easily explained; works on a mass scale \\u2014 affects millions or even billions of people, and has the potential to cause serious damage \\u2014 such as undermining democratic elections or keeping whole swathes of our population imprisoned. The central premise is these weapons of math destruction have the ability to create feedback loops that spread inequality and because we can\\u2019t see inside these algorithms, we\\u2019ll have no idea how to correct them. It\\u2019s only after we look back and observe the immense damage \\u2014 such as in the 2016 election or 2008 financial crises (both caused by algorithms harnessed for negative ends) \\u2014 the harm our blind trust in these models can cause. Furthermore, our models are only as good as the data that are put in, and when that data is biased, then the predictions from the model will be as well. Consider a model for sentencing offenders that takes into account a person\\u2019s time of first encounter with law enforcement. Due to unjust policing strategies such as stop and frisk, a black man is likely to have a run-in with the police at a much younger age than a white man even accounting for other factors. This will result in the model recommending a longer prison sentence for blacks, during which these individuals will be losing out on economic opportunities and becoming ostracized from society. Those individuals are then more likely to re-offend, leading to a vicious cycle of imprisonment all started because of data generated by an unjust policy and then fed into a black box. O\\u2019Neil\\u2019s book, released in early 2016, is needed now more than ever before. The end of 2016 saw the devastation wreaked on the American democratic process by Russian actors who took advantage of Facebook\\u2019s algorithms to spread propaganda. Far from being an academic exercise, these actions had real-world consequences, raising into question the legitimacy of elections in the United States. Far-right advertisements continue to plague Facebook, driven by an algorithm that (most likely, we don\\u2019t really know) considers engagement as the top priority. Algorithms are only going to play a larger role in our daily lives moving forward. Already, where we go to school, what we read, whether we are approved for a loan, if we get a job, and what we buy are all decided to a significant extent by algorithms we have no control over and cannot query for an explanation. O\\u2019Neil\\u2019s book may seem pessimistic about machine learning models, but I like to think of it more as a necessary criticism: with so much unbridled enthusiasm surrounding machine learning, we need people who are willing to take a step back and ask: are these tools really improving peoples\\u2019 lives and how should we as a society adopt them? Machine learning algorithms are just tools, and as with any tools, they can be used for good and bad. Fortunately, we are still at an early stage which means we can shape the use of models to ensure they work towards making objective decisions and creating the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. The choices we make now in this regard will shape the future of data science in the decades to come, and it\\u2019s best to go into these debates well-informed. 3. (Tie) Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths and How Not to be Wrong: The Power of Mathematical Thinking by Jordan Ellenberg Computer science and statistics (and every other field of study) suffer from one problem when they are taught in school: they are boring in the abstract. It\\u2019s only when they are applied to real-world problems that they become interesting enough to make us want to understand. Both of these books do an incredible job of transforming dry subjects into entertaining and informative narratives about how to use algorithms, stats, and maths in our daily lives. For example, in Algorithms to Live By, the authors show how we can use the idea of the explore vs exploit tradeoff and optimal stopping to find out how long we should spend searching for a spouse (or new employee, restaurant for dinner, etc.). Likewise, we can use sorting algorithms to organize our belongings most efficiently for retrieving what you need quickly. You thought you knew these ideas, and you may even be able to write them in code, but you\\u2019ve probably never applied them to optimize your life. The main idea of How Not to be Wrong is similar as Ellenburg takes us through stories showing both the use and misuse of statistical concepts like linear regression, inference, Bayesian inference, and probability. Applying the laws of probability show us that playing the lottery is always a losing proposition, \\u2014 except in the rare cases where the payoff is actually positive (as was discovered by a group of MIT students). Ellenburg does not shy away from showing us equations, but he applies them to real-world situations. The central quote of Ellenburg\\u2019s book is mathematical thinking is \\u201cthe extension of common sense by other means.\\u201d In many situations, primarily in the distant past, our intuitions serve us well, but, now in the modern world, there are many cases where our initial response is completely false (see the next book). In these circumstances, we need to rely not on instincts but can instead use probability and statistics in order to arrive at the best decision. Both books are at the exact right level of rigor \\u2014 mixing in a few equations with plenty of stories \\u2014 and they are both enjoyable to read. Throughout these books, I found plenty of data science concepts I had never quite grasped in a classroom finally clicking and over and over again I experienced the joy of an \\u201caha\\u201d moment. Math, statistics, and computer science are only useful to the extent they can affect your life for the better, and both of these books demonstrate all the uses of these subjects you\\u2019ve never stopped to consider. 4. Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahneman If you haven\\u2019t realized it yet, then here\\u2019s a useful lesson: humans are irrational and we routinely make terrible decisions in all aspects of life. However, there is reason for hope: once we understand why we don\\u2019t act optimally, we can start to alter our behavior for better outcomes. This is the central premise of Kahneman\\u2019s masterwork documenting decades of experimental findings. Kahneman (the 2002 Nobel Prize winner in Economics) along with his research partner Amos Tversky (in addition to others such as Richard Thaler), created the highly influential field of behaviorial economics which treats people not as rational utility maximizers, but as the irrational decision-makers we actually are. This has created a real shift in thinking and design choices not only in economics, but in areas of life as diverse as medicine, sports, business practices, energy savings, and retirement funding. We can also apply many of the findings to data science, such as how to present study results. In this rigorous yet highly enjoyable work, Kahneman outlines all the ways in which we don\\u2019t act logically including the anchoring, availability, and substitution heuristics (rules of thumb) or our tendency towards loss aversion and falling prey to the sunk cost fallacy. He also outlines what is perhaps the most important takeaway: that we have two different systems of thought. Using System 1 is natural, and we have to overcome millions of years of evolution to employ System 2. Even though it\\u2019s difficult, in our data-rich world, we need to spend time honing our System 2 thinking. Sure, we may sometimes run into problems with overthinking, but underthinking \\u2014 using System 1 instead of System 2 \\u2014 is a far more serious problem. This book also has conclusions that apply outside of data science like the idea of two selves: experiencing and remembering. The experiencing self is the moment-to-moment feelings we have during an event but is much less important than the remembering self which is our perception of the event afterwards. The remembering self rates an experience according to the Peak-End rule which has profound implications for medicine, life satisfaction, and forcing ourselves to do unpleasant tasks. We will remember events for far longer than we experience them, so it\\u2019s crucial that during an experience, we try to maximize the future satisfaction of our remembering self. If you want to understand actual human psychology, not the idealized version presented in traditional classrooms, then this book is the best place to start. 5. (Dark horse): The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable by Nassim Nicholas Taleb There is only one place for Taleb to occupy on a list, and it\\u2019s that of an outsider. Taleb, a former quantitative trader who made substantial sums during market downturns in 2000 and 2007, has made himself into a vocal scholar-researcher achieving worldwide acclaim and criticism for his works. Primarily, Taleb is occupied with one idea: the failure of contemporary ways of thinking especially in times of great uncertainty. In The Black Swan, Taleb puts forth the concept that we are blind to the randomness that rules human activities, and, as a result, are devastated when things do not turn out as expected. Originally published in 2007, The Black Swan has become more relevant since the unexpected events of 2008 and 2016 which completely upended traditional models. Of course, the question that immediately comes up based on the central premise, is: well don\\u2019t improbable events by definition not happen very often and so we shouldn\\u2019t be worried about them? The critical point is that while each improbable event by itself is unlikely to happen, taken together, there is a near certainty that many unexpected events will occur in your lifetime, or even in a single year. The chance of an economic crash occurring in any one year is miniscule, but the probabilities add up until an economic downturn every decade somewhere in the world is a near possibility. We should not only expect world-changing events to happen with high frequency, but we should not listen to experts who are constrained by what has occurred in the past. As anyone who invests in the stock market should know, past performance is no predictor of future performance, a lesson we\\u2019d be wise to consider in our data science models (which use past data). Also, our world is not normally distributed, but instead fat-tailed, with a few extreme events \\u2014 the Great Recession \\u2014 or a few wealthy individuals \\u2014 Bill Gates \\u2014 overshadowing all the others. When extreme events occur, no one is prepared because they far exceed the magnitude of any previous ones. The Black Swan is important for data scientists because it shows that any models based only on past performance will often be wrong with disastrous consequences. All machine learning models are built only with past data which means we don\\u2019t want to trust them too much. Models (Taleb\\u2019s included) are flawed approximations of reality, and we should make sure we have systems in place to deal with their inevitable failures. As a note, Taleb has gained a reputation not only for his novel ideas, but also for being extremely combative. He is willing to take on all comers and regularly criticizes scholars like Steven Pinker, or public figures like Nate Silver. His ideas are helpful to understand in our heavily skewed times, but his attitude can be slightly off-putting. Nonetheless, I think this book is a worthwhile read because it offers a non-mainstream thought system. (This book is the second in Taleb\\u2019s five-part Incerto laying out his complete philosophy. The Black Swan discusses the concept of highly improbable events, while the fourth book in the Incerto, Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder discusses ways in which you can make yourself not just robust to disruption, but set yourself up to be better off because of it. I think The Black Swan is the most relevant of the bunch for data science). After a long day of staring at a computer screen, I can think of no better way to end the day than with a book (print, ebook, or audiobook it doesn\\u2019t matter). Data science requires constantly expanding the tools in your toolkit, and, even when we want something to relax and take our minds off work, that doesn\\u2019t mean we can\\u2019t be learning. These books are all engrossing reads that also teach us lessons about data science and life. The 6 works described here will provide a helpful supplement to more technical works by demonstrating what actually drives humans. Understanding how people think in reality \\u2014 as opposed to idealized models \\u2014 is just as critical as statistics for enabling better data-driven decisions. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. The sunk-cost fallacy is one of many harmful cognitive biases to which humans fall prey. It refers to our tendency to continue to devote time and resources to a lost cause because we have already spent \\u2014 sunk \\u2014 so much time in the pursuit. The sunk-cost fallacy applies to staying in bad jobs longer than we should, slaving away at a project even when it\\u2019s clear it won\\u2019t work, and yes, continuing to use a tedious, outdated plotting library \\u2014 matplotlib \\u2014 when more efficient, interactive, and better-looking alternatives exist. Over the past few months, I\\u2019ve realized the only reason I use matplotlib is the hundreds of hours I\\u2019ve sunk into learning the convoluted syntax. This complication leads to hours of frustration on StackOverflow figuring out how to format dates or add a second y-axis. Fortunately, this is a great time for Python plotting, and after exploring the options, a clear winner \\u2014 in terms of ease-of-use, documentation, and functionality \\u2014 is the plotly Python library. In this article, we\\u2019ll dive right into plotly, learning how to make better plots in less time \\u2014 often with one line of code. All of the code for this article is available on GitHub. The charts are all interactive and can be viewed on NBViewer here. The plotly Python package is an open-source library built on plotly.js which in turn is built on d3.js. We\\u2019ll be using a wrapper on plotly called cufflinks designed to work with Pandas dataframes. So, our entire stack is cufflinks > plotly > plotly.js > d3.js which means we get the efficiency of coding in Python with the incredible interactive graphics capabilities of d3. (Plotly itself is a graphics company with several products and open-source tools. The Python library is free to use, and we can make unlimited charts in offline mode plus up to 25 charts in online mode to share with the world.) All the work in this article was done in a Jupyter Notebook with plotly + cufflinks running in offline mode. After installing plotly and cufflinks with pip install cufflinks plotly import the following to run in Jupyter: Single variable \\u2014 univariate \\u2014 plots are a standard way to start an analysis and the histogram is a go-to plot (although it has some issues) for graphing a distribution. Here, using my Medium article statistics (you can see how to get your own stats here or use mine here) let\\u2019s make an interactive histogram of the number of claps for articles ( df is a standard Pandas dataframe): For those used to matplotlib, all we have to do is add one more letter ( iplot instead of plot) and we get a much better-looking and interactive chart! We can click on the data to get more details, zoom into sections of the plot, and as we\\u2019ll see later, select different categories to highlight. If we want to plot overlaid histograms, that\\u2019s just as simple: With a little bit of pandas manipulation, we can do a barplot: s we saw, we can combine the power of pandas with plotly + cufflinks. For a boxplot of the fans per story by publication, we use a pivot and then plot: The benefits of interactivity are that we can explore and subset the data as we like. There\\u2019s a lot of information in a boxplot, and without the ability to see the numbers, we\\u2019ll miss most of it! The scatterplot is the heart of most analyses. It allows us to see the evolution of a variable over time or the relationship between two (or more) variables. A considerable portion of real-world data has a time element. Luckily, plotly + cufflinks was designed with time-series visualizations in mind. Let\\u2019s make a dataframe of my TDS articles and look at how the trends have changed. Here we are doing quite a few different things all in one line: For more information, we can also add in text annotations quite easily: For a two-variable scatter plot colored by a third categorical variable we use: Let\\u2019s get a little more sophisticated by using a log axis \\u2014 specified as a plotly layout \\u2014 (see the Plotly documentation for the layout specifics) and sizing the bubbles by a numeric variable: With a little more work (see notebook for details), we can even put four variables (this is not advised) on one graph! As before, we can combine pandas with plotly+cufflinks for useful plots See the notebook or the documentation for more examples of added functionality. We can add in text annotations, reference lines, and best-fit lines to our plots with a single line of code, and still with all the interaction. Now we\\u2019ll get into a few plots that you probably won\\u2019t use all that often, but which can be quite impressive. We\\u2019ll use the plotly figure_factory, to keep even these incredible plots to one line. When we want to explore relationships among many variables, a scattermatrix (also called a splom) is a great option: Even this plot is completely interactive allowing us to explore the data. To visualize the correlations between numeric variables, we calculate the correlations and then make an annotated heatmap: The list of plots goes on and on. Cufflinks also has several themes we can use to get completely different styling with no effort. For example, below we have a ratio plot in the \\u201cspace\\u201d theme and a spread plot in \\u201cggplot\\u201d: We also get 3D plots (surface and bubble): For those who are so inclined, you can even make a pie chart: When you make these plots in the notebook, you\\u2019ll notice a small link on the lower right-hand side on the graph that says \\u201cExport to plot.ly\\u201d. If you click that link, you are then taken to the chart studio where you can touch up your plot for a final presentation. You can add annotations, specify the colors, and generally clean everything up for a great figure. Then, you can publish your figure online so anyone can find it with the link. Below are two charts I touched up in Chart Studio: With everything mentioned here, we are still not exploring the full capabilities of the library! I\\u2019d encourage you to check out both the plotly and the cufflinks documentation for more incredible graphics. The worst part about the sunk cost fallacy is you only realize how much time you\\u2019ve wasted after you\\u2019ve quit the endeavor. Fortunately, now that I\\u2019ve made the mistake of sticking with matploblib for too long, you don\\u2019t have to! When thinking about plotting libraries, there are a few things we want: As of right now, the best option for doing all of these in Python is plotly. Plotly allows us to make visualizations quickly and helps us get better insight into our data through interactivity. Also, let\\u2019s admit it, plotting should be one of the most enjoyable parts of data science! With other libraries, plotting turned into a tedious task, but with plotly, there is again joy in making a great figure! Now that it\\u2019s 2019, it is time to upgrade your Python plotting library for better efficiency, functionality, and aesthetics in your data science visualizations. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. In his sweeping 2011 work The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined, Steven Pinker makes the audacious claim, \\u201ctoday we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species\\u2019 existence.\\u201d To someone who pays even a little attention to constant news reports of violence, both local and international, this statement sounds ludicrous. The grandeur of this assertion should immediately raise our suspicions; as the science popularizer Carl Sagan often said, \\u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\\u201d Does Pinker have that evidence and does he interpret it correctly? Over the course of 800 pages, Pinker makes a convincing argument with numbers, figures, and references to many books and articles. Nonetheless, it\\u2019s critical that we don\\u2019t rely on a single argument to form our worldview. We must remember that data is never objective, and therefore we need to look at the data itself as well as multiple expert interpretations. In this article, we\\u2019ll examine the global violent conflict data and different stances on the same numbers. (As a note, Pinker\\u2019s work deals with all forms of violence from the individual \\u2014 homicides, abuse \\u2014 to the worldwide, but here we\\u2019ll focus on international violent conflicts \\u2014 war \\u2014 and leave the rest for future articles). This is Episode 2 of the Reality Project, an endeavor with the aim of becoming less wrong about the world with data. You can find all the articles here. (I\\u2019d like to emphasize I\\u2019m not trying to minimize the atrocities of war by presenting only data. It can be easy to lose track that we are talking about people when looking at numbers and every loss of human life is a tragedy.) Our primary sources of derived data on the more positive side will be The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker and the \\u201cWar and Peace\\u201d page on Our World in Data. For a contrasting viewpoint, we\\u2019ll use \\u201cSteven Pinker is Wrong\\u201d by John Gray and \\u201cThe Decline of Conflict: What Do the Data Really Say?\\u201d by Pasquale Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. You can find raw data for your own analysis at The Conflict Catalog or the World Bank. The first question we need to ask to assess violence today is how violent was the past. While extremely reliable data is difficult to come by, anthropologists use archaeological evidence to determine causes of death and therefore approximate the rates of violence in a society. These results are shown in the following graphs of percentages of deaths that come from violent conflict in prehistoric and non-state societies (from Our World in Data). The percentages of individuals killed by violence ranges from about 60% to less than 5% in both prehistoric and nonstate societies. Those numbers are almost meaningless until we put them in perspective with modern figures: The most relevant entries are the final two. The US and Europe from 1900\\u20131960, even with two world wars, saw less than 1% of their population perish in armed conflicts. In 2007, just 0.04% of deaths in the world were from international violence. If this data is correct, the world in 2007 was at least an order of magnitude safer than most prehistoric societies. We can also look at the same data in a slightly different manner, as the violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per year. Here we again see the same pattern of lower violence in modern times. On the left are non-state societies and on the right are state societies. Focusing on the bottom 3 rows of the right-hand table, we can see the strikingly low rates of violent death among modern societies, even accounting for two world wars. Again, it\\u2019s worth stressing the data here is not complete, but what is available suggests the following hypothesis: prehistoric and nonstate societies experienced much higher rates of violence than modern state societies. As Pinker and others (notably Jared Diamond) have made clear, the \\u201cnoble savage\\u201d idea is entirely false. People did not live peacefully with one another when they were organized in tribes and then become more violent as they were civilized, but the opposite: they were extremely violent in tribes and gradually became less so as larger civilizations were built and commerce started to connect the world (this highlights two of the drivers in the decline of global war \\u2014 trade and powerful states \\u2014 that we\\u2019ll look at shortly). Even accounting for the atrocities wrought by nation-states in the 20th century, rates of violent death appear to be lower now than at any previous point. It\\u2019s worth looking into the period of time for which we have the best data: the modern age. In particular, we\\u2019ll zoom in on the post-1945 era, a time that Pinker has classified as \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d. From this vantage point, things look very good. As noted by Pinker, since 1953, there have been zero conflicts between major world powers (the exception since WW2 was the Korean War) and there have been zero internationally recognized states that have gone out of existence through conquest since 1945. When we look at the data on battle deaths per 100,000 people in state-based conflicts, we see a significant decline since World War Two. Since the end of the second world war, the rate of deaths from all conflicts has decreased, with the most noticeable decline in conflicts between states. Most of the remaining battle deaths occur in civil conflicts, such as the tragic civil war in Syria that has been ongoing since 2011. Moreover, many of these civil wars involve foreign states, and the argument could be made major states have stopped fighting each other directly, but engage through other conflicts. One discouraging bit of news in contrast to the above graph is the number of overall state conflicts since the second world war: While the number of battle-related deaths (in the rate of people killed / 100,000 / year) has decreased, the total number of conflict is rising. This tells us that, contrary to what we might think as weapon technology advances, violent conflicts are resulting in fewer battle deaths. While, there are more civil conflicts around the globe, these tend to be less catastrophic than wars between major powers. Fortunately, the wars between major states have been on the decline \\u2014 even including the entire 20th century \\u2014 and show no signs of reversal. We can see this in the final chart of section showing the percent of the time major powers have been at war over the past 500 years (grouped into 25-year periods). There has been a clear decline in the percentage of years in which the major powers fought with one another since at least 1600. At one point the rate reached 100% \\u2014 indicating there was at least one conflict between world powers for the entire 25-year period. Contrast that with 2000, when there were 0 conflicts between world powers. The current period of 66 years without a conflict between major powers is the longest time since at least the Roman Empire. After an exploration of the data thus far, Pinker\\u2019s argument looks to be holding up: the rate of death in battle for modern state societies in war is much lower than prehistoric and non-state societies even accounting for the world wars. Furthermore, the major powers no longer fight one another and while the number of civil conflicts has increased, these result in fewer deaths than conflicts between major states. However, before we consider this case to be closed we need to talk about one fundamental issue. Consider the following two scenarios: Which is worse? The question depends on your observation point. On the ground, observing from the location of the conflict itself, the bar is much worse. An individual in the bar has a 1 in 2 chance of being killed. From an outsider\\u2019s vantage point the civil war is much worse with a total loss of life 10 times greater. This is one of the central arguments that Pinker\\u2019s critics make: measuring violence in rates ignores the absolute numbers which means it does not account for the actual amount of human suffering. One of Pinker\\u2019s harshest critics, Nassim Taleb, brings up the point of units in his response. He illustrates it with the following pair of plots: The graph on the left shows the raw number of casualties versus time for major conflicts. The graph on the right shows the rescaled version where the populations have been standardized across all times to have the same base population. As an example, if we have a population 100 society that suffers 2 deaths and a society with 1000 people that suffers 10, we would multiply 2 * 10 to get 20 deaths to account for the population difference. These figures encapsulate the rates/absolute numbers argument: the rates of death in violent conflicts have clearly been decreasing and are at a historical low, but the actual number of deaths has increased over time. Although, it\\u2019s worth pointing out the actual number has decreased since 1950. I don\\u2019t know if I have an answer for you on this problem of relative/absolute. As a utilitarian, I believe in bringing the greatest amount of total good to the greatest amount of people, and therefore, I see the total number of humans dead as the mark of how our civilization has failed. On the other side of the argument, a human alive today has less probability of being killed in a violent conflict than at any point in the past which is no doubt progress. I\\u2019ll let the facts stand and allow you to decide for yourself. Even if we don\\u2019t want to make a judgment on the overall outcome, it\\u2019s worth taking a look at the potential causes for the reduction in rates of violence. In particular, we might want to think about why the total number of deaths (in addition to the relative measures) have fallen since 1945. For this section, we will look at Steven Pinker\\u2019s ideas as outlined in The Better Angels of Our Nature. (This work is the best look at potential reasons why violence has declined \\u2014 partly because others refuse to concede this point). Pinker explains five forces, intended to account for the decline of violence on all scales, not just state-based conflicts, but we\\u2019ll focus on the first two which are most relevant to international conflict. The five historical forces behind the reduction in violence are: A powerful central government that can make and enforce laws using violence means that citizens are less likely to take punishment into their own hands, a concept known as the Leviathon theory. For all its romantic appeal, vigilante justice only leads to unending cycles of revenge violence. When citizens can count on a government to deliver fair punishments, they let the judicial system enforce the rules. Also, a state can prevent crime by making the penalty far greater than any potential payoff. Humans have the potential for both evil and good, and a strong central government with a fair criminal justice system with disincentives can steer them on the right path. A strong government alone is not enough for keeping the peace between nations though. On an international scale, the evidence suggests that democracies don\\u2019t fight each other possibly because of the ideals they share in common. Looking at some of the data, it\\u2019s clear that democracies just don\\u2019t fight one another directly anymore (although they may engage in proxy war). (For more on this concept see \\u201cDemocratic Peace Theory.\\u201d) The idea that one democratic nation will not fight another is good news as democracies on the rise in the long run worldwide as shown by Pinker: (One counterpoint is the recent decline in Democratic Index which measures not just the government but also freedom of the press and voting rights. Although the long-term trends are positive, the recent declines are worrying.) The theory of gentle commerce can be summed up in two statements: Why don\\u2019t you steal a loaf of bread from the grocery store? Although most people believe they don\\u2019t steal because it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do, the real reason is more mundane: in our society, the potential cost of getting caught stealing \\u2014 jail time and social ostracization \\u2014 are higher than the cost to purchase items. When people are provided a legal means to obtain their goods that is cheaper than violence, they will take the legal option. We explored the second point in \\u201cThe Disappearing Poor\\u201d, but it\\u2019s worth reiterating. Without exchanges in a market economy, all interactions between humans are zero-sum: you can steal something from me, but your gain is offset by my loss so humanity is no better off; the size of the economy stays the same. However, in an exchange of goods, both parties come out better ahead. Exchange also allows for specialization so different individuals/countries can make the goods for which they are best suited. Moreover, as trade continues, countries become dependent on one another because they no longer make all the goods they need. The end result of exchange is more plentiful goods at cheaper prices for all parties and improved international relations. Over the past several hundred years, we have slowly built up an international marketplace where all players are heavily dependent on one another. The US will not fight with another major power, not because she couldn\\u2019t defeat them, but because the economic losses would far outweigh the gains. As discussed by Pinker, countries that depend more on each other for trade are less likely to have a violent conflict controlling for other factors. In summary, the financial incentives have switched from war to trade for most nations. The Leviathon and gentle commerce actually work together \\u2014 a strong government is able to create markets that allow for safe exchanges and enforce laws regulating trade. In other words, once you have a strong state, trading is easier, and more trading between nations means they are less likely to attack one another. As trade between world powers has increased, conflicts between major powers has also decreased to 0 since 1953. There are doubtless other factors that have played a role in the decline of war between nations. We discussed external historical factors behind the decrease, but Pinker and others (John Horgan in The End of War) have also outlined internal factors, like The Better Angels of Our Nature : empathy, self-control, morals, reason. By examining the data and the reasons, it\\u2019s clear that the major powers no longer see war as a feasible choice. This is not necessarily because they are ethical, but because the economics of war no longer makes sense. At the end of the day, humans \\u2014 and nations \\u2014 are driven by incentives, and through international trade, we have built a world where the incentives favor peace. In a narrow point of view, Pinker is correct: rates of violent conflict have substantially decreased and there is reason to believe they are at the lowest point in human history (if only because data is limited). Also, at least among modern democracies, violence is no longer seen as the default option for solving problems as it has been for almost all of human history. That being said, it\\u2019s worth thinking about how Pinker\\u2019s argument made be misleading. The first point is that by focusing on rates rather than numbers, we are neglecting the actual human suffering. More people dying from war is more people dying from war even if the percentage is decreasing. The numbers can be used to support multiple conclusions depending on one\\u2019s argument. A second central issue is, especially for pre-historic societies, reliable data is hard to get. Most of the numbers for conflict rates and deaths in prehistoric societies come by examining archaeological sites and looking at artifacts for evidence of violent death. However, it could be possible these marks have been misinterpreted and anthropologists could not possibly have studied all prehistoric societies. Simple extrapolation what has been found is the only option, but it\\u2019s also important to not draw immature conclusions. The last major issue we\\u2019ll cover here (for more see Taleb\\u2019s article) is that we could be living in an anomalous age. Pinker calls the most recent 70 years of peace (no wars between modern nations), \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d, but it could be really only the temporary peace. Furthermore, as pointed out by Taleb, wars tend to be power law distributed, that is, they have long tails skewed to the right. The vast majority of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by a small number of the conflicts as can be seen below: One single conflict can completely outweigh all others in terms of deaths. Most of the armed conflicts since 1945 have fallen on the low end of the scale, but it only takes a single major battle to overshadow the peace since 1945. It\\u2019s possible a new conflict, one caused by global warming, resource shortages, or territorial disputes, could entirely undo the millennia of progress humans have made on violence reduction efforts. Initially, after reading Pinker\\u2019s book, I was convinced by his thesis. However, after taking the time to dig through the facts myself, a more nuanced picture emerged, one where sensationalist conflicts on both sides are not warranted. I see reasons for optimism: decreasing rates of deaths in armed conflicts mean a human alive today is less likely to die in battle than in recorded history, no battles between major powers since 1953, and a reduction in overall battle deaths since the 1950s, as well as reasons for pessimism: democracy and international trade, so important for reducing major conflicts, appear to be on a decline in recent years. Moreover, while major powers no longer fight directly with each other, they are involved through proxy wars. The exploration of violent conflict highlights the objective of the Reality Project. It\\u2019s not designed to be a feel-good effort but a fact-based endeavor, and, thus, any time I encounter an argument that is appealing to me this should only tell me to be more skeptical. The Reality Project has allegiances to no single interest, except getting at the actual statistics behind our world. It\\u2019s nice when the facts make us optimistic, but even when they don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s critical to understand the data so we can work to improve things. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Every day for 25 years, newspapers could have correctly run the headline \\u201c130,000 People Escape Extreme Poverty Yesterday\\u201d (source). Instead, as far as I can tell, this has appeared on the front page of a major newspaper precisely 0 times. Maybe this explains the incredibly terrible results recorded by people on this simple question (from Gapminder): When this question was asked in the United States, 5% of humans got the correct answer, C: almost halved. Animals, on the other hand, answer this question with 33% accuracy (because they randomly guess). How is it possible for people in a supposedly literate society like the US to be so wrong about reality? I don\\u2019t like to place blame, but in this case, it\\u2019s likely justified: the media has succeeded in a campaign to misinform us about the world. Instead of reporting facts, they have chosen to activate our natural inclination towards xenophobia (fear of outsiders) by convincing us there is a \\u201cdeveloped world\\u201d with well-off people, and then there is everyone else, a mass of poor hordes that will never be able to rise from poverty. This is episode one of the Reality Project, a weekly series dedicated to becoming less wrong about the world with data. First, we need to look at the statistics. The single best resource on this topic is the Our World in Data \\u201cGlobal Extreme Poverty\\u201d page. You can view all the numbers there, but one chart suffices to show the drastic decline in poverty: We can see that the definition of poverty varies by institution, but no matter which definition we use, the rates have drastically increased. Sure, the rate is decreasing, but because there are more people, doesn\\u2019t that mean more people are still poor? Where do these people go as they rise from extreme poverty? Simple: into the global middle class. As of this writing, about 85% of people in the world (6 billion out of 7 billion) are at or above the middle part of the global income scale. Making a distinction between \\u201cdeveloped\\u201d and \\u201cdeveloping\\u201d is the wrong way of looking at the world: there are not two income levels, but rather a smooth scale which people everywhere are rapidly climbing. We can observe the drastic increase in worldwide wealth in the numbers. As global poverty declines, incomes increase as shown in GDP per capita over time (from the Our World in Data \\u201cEconomic Growth\\u201d page): So, the facts are unequivocal that poverty is declining and incomes are increasing at an extremely rapid pace, but does this actually matter? It is possible that people are making more money but not having better lives? All of this may look nice, but you may be wondering if the rise in wealth actually means that people are better off. Well, based on the following chart showing life dissatisfaction vs GDP per capita, the answer is a resounding yes. As wealth increases, people become more satisfied with life. Money is not a magical cure for all ills, and the effects only persist up to a certain income level but wealth is positive because of the side effects it brings with it: lower infant mortality, more educational opportunities, and fewer working hours. It can be easy to lose sight of the humans in all the numbers so it\\u2019s critical to remember that behind every one of these data points is a person. Billions of people rising out of poverty means mothers who don\\u2019t have to bury their children because care improves with wealth, girls who are able to attend high school, and families that are living healthier, happier lives. I\\u2019m not very good at talking about individual humans, but Hans Rosling provides stories (in addition to facts) in his excellent book Factfulness. As for me, I\\u2019ll end this section with another chart from Our World in Data which demonstrates why less poverty is positive: The data could not be more clear: around the world, humans are rising out of poverty and into the middle class. As a consequence, they are living longer, going to school more, working less, and leading more enjoyable lives. There are likely many factors at play behind this decline (as with any human phenomenon) but I\\u2019ll focus on the most compelling argument: commerce. (For a full treatment of this subject, see Matt Ridley\\u2019s The Rational Optimist). For hundreds of thousands of years, humans engaged in zero-sum interactions: one person stole or killed another person, so someone\\u2019s gain was offset by someone else\\u2019s loss. In this system, the overall state of humanity could improve only glacially if at all (new tools that raised living standards spread very slowly when communication was limited to walking speed). However, beginning around 1000 AD in Europe, a new form of interaction emerged: economic exchanges in which both parties came out better off. This invention, known as commerce, completely changed the game: people were now able to enter into positive-sum exchanges where both parties gained. This is a fundamental building block of civilization: in commerce, both the person selling a good and the person buying a good come out ahead. For most of history, humanity had a constant amount of material wealth which could change hands but did not increase overall. With the invention of commerce, the size of the economic pie itself increases as people trade goods and specialize. Both within and between country exchanges lead to a division of labor wherein people or countries specialize in fulfilling one role, leading to massive increases in efficiency. It took humans a long time to figure out, but once we created exchanges and market economies, we started on the incredible upward journey in wealth that continues to this day. We can see the beneficial effects of trade in recent years on the following chart. As countries trade more, they grow wealthier: Don\\u2019t mistake me for a free-market evangelist. Before I began my efforts to get less wrong about the world through data, I was an avowed Socialist who upheld the Nordic countries as paragons to emulate. However, my exploration of the numbers has led to the conclusion that free markets and the exchange they enable are the drivers for escaping poverty. I also still believe in the role of government: tight government controls in areas like environmental protection and worker rights are critical for making sure that increased wealth does not come at the cost of environmental devastation. The remarkable ability of commerce to lift people out of poverty can be seen in China, which over the past 40 years has undergone the most incredible wealth increase in history. As described in How China Escaped the Poverty Trap, China\\u2019s extraordinary escape from poverty occurred as the communist leaders gradually opened the nation to commerce, crucially, trade with other nations. In 1978, China allowed foreign trade, and in the 40 years since, has once again become a world power. Along the way, the living standards of hundreds of millions of people has been raised. (Not only does commerce lead to rising income, but it also leads to decreasing rates of violence within and between nations. As documented by Steven Pinker in The Better Angels of Our Nature, when it is cheaper to buy something from someone than to steal it, economics wins out. Our neighbors become more valuable to us alive than dead which means less killing and more trading. This is known as the theory of gentle commerce.) While the long-term picture is overwhelmingly positive, it\\u2019s important to also focus on the realities that still need to be improved. At the moment, there are remain hundreds of millions of people in extreme poverty around the world and every one of these people deserves to rise into the middle class. The unfortunate reality is that the vast proportion of the world\\u2019s poor are in Africa where groups like the United Nations are working to end poverty through targeted spending programs and the institution of social safety nets. There are around 750 million people still in extreme poverty today. Nonetheless, considering 1.2 billion people moved out of extreme poverty from 1990\\u20132015, there is every indication that extreme poverty can be ended. Furthermore, any time the issue of income is brought up, we have to mention income inequality. If countries are getting richer, but the wealth is going to fewer people, then is humanity really better off? Once again, it\\u2019s worth looking at the data, this time on inequality both within and between countries. We\\u2019ll turn to the Our World in Data articles \\u201cIncome Inequality\\u201d and \\u201cGlobal Economic Inequality\\u201d for the facts. Fortunately, the numbers again provide an optimistic answer. While within-country inequality has increased in a few countries, overall, global inequality has decreased and is projected to continue to decrease. From the following plot, we can see that some countries have experienced an increase in inequality within their borders if we define inequality as the share of total income going to the top 1%. (This definition may have some issues). On the other hand, global economic inequality has declined: In summary, when looking at inequalities, the wealth distribution may be getting more skewed within some countries, but overall, because overall levels of wealth have increased most rapidly in the poorest nations, even those at the bottom of the income level are better off. I won\\u2019t go into the debate about whether inequality is even negative, but, taking a long-term worldwide view of the situation, it does not appear to be worse now. The news is not only misinforming you about the world but, by promoting a false picture, it\\u2019s stealing something valuable: the joy that comes with seeing the world is getting better. While it\\u2019s important to be realistic about the challenges we face in the short term, it\\u2019s also critical to take a look at the big picture and realize that all of our collective efforts are making a difference. I would like to end on one final chart which highlights the most important part of The Reality Project: when we realize that worldwide poverty is decreasing it should give us confidence that efforts to eliminate poverty are not foolish. Although the greatest contributor to declining poverty is (most likely) commerce, poverty reduction efforts such as those advocated by the United Nations are also vital. If you think poverty rates are increasing, then your only conclusion must be that these programs don\\u2019t work. If, on the other hand, you have dug into the data as we did and discovered the true state of the world, you realize these efforts have made a difference. The poverty reduction program delivered benefits to the recipients far exceeding costs (read the details in \\u201cA Multifaceted Program Causes Lasting Progress for the Very Poor: Evidence from Six Countries\\u201d). The next time someone claims there will always be poor people and there\\u2019s no use in helping them, gently correct them, not with opinions, but with data. In addition to the sources listed throughout the article, here are some resources for your own research. I welcome any discussion. As always, I welcome feedback, conversation, and constructive dissent. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Strange and wonderful things happen when you put down the newspaper, turn off the tv, and decide to look at actual statistics about the world instead of relying on what you\\u2019ve been told. The ground begins to shift beneath your feet as you realize the worldview which the news has been feeding you \\u2014 that the world is on a downward slide \\u2014 is, based on almost every single factual measure, in direct opposition to reality. Once we look at the data on topics such as wealth, health, human rights, and environmental protection, we are left with no option but to conclude the world has been on an upward trajectory for most of recorded history, we live in the best time ever for human civilization, and the improvement shows no signs of stopping. Over the past five years, as I\\u2019ve slowly weaned myself from a debilitating news addiction, I\\u2019ve experienced what can only be described as an update to the worldview-generating software in my brain. Through tens of thousands of book pages, millions of data points, and countless charts, my view of the world as a dark, dangerous place and humanity as an evil force has reversed. Based on the data, the story of the world has flipped: the history of humanity is not one of decline, but a gradual ascent continuing to today. As a new year begins, and now that I\\u2019ve assimilated enough independent sources of data to be confident reality is really better than we think, I\\u2019m starting The Reality Project, a data-driven endeavor to present the world as it is through a series of weekly articles. The stated goal is to become less wrong about the world through data, disposing of our distorted worldviews. If, along the way, the data happen to give you a more optimistic view of humanity, then consider it as a beneficial side effect. The first article in The Reality Project, \\u201cThe Disappearing Poor\\u201d is here. You can find all the published articles in The Reality Project here. Each week, I\\u2019ll be writing about statistics concerning different aspects of our world, selected based on the views where I was initially most wrong. These will cover topics from the environment to democracy to nuclear weapons \\u2014 if humans are involved and there is reliable data, it falls in this purview although the focus will generally be on the big picture instead of daily minutiae. The articles will be short and informative, and each piece of data must be confirmed by independent sources to make it into The Reality Project. Upfront, I\\u2019d like to make clear I make no claims to have a monopoly on the truth. I\\u2019m aware that data is subject to the biases of those collecting and reporting it. However, just the possibility we may be proved wrong is not a reason to prevent us from trying to get at the truth. Science, and by extension humanity, advances through a process of gathering data, questioning theories, and discarding ideas when they are no longer supported by data. My beliefs are never set in stone, and when the evidence changes, or when I find data contradicting my existing ideas, it will not be suppressed but reported! Being less wrong about the world has not just been a vanity project. My fact-based worldview has altered the way I live for the better and I believe an accurate conception of the world is vital for society. Prior to this worldview software upgrade, I never volunteered or contributed to charitable causes based on simple reasoning: the world is a terrible place, you have to look out for yourself, and there will always be poor/sick/oppressed/hungry people so there\\u2019s no use trying to make a difference. The single most important effect of learning the real state of the world is seeing that worldwide efforts in areas such as poverty reduction, human rights expansion, and disease eradication have been overwhelming successes. These programs make a difference and prove that people acting together can reduce the suffering of conscious beings on a global scale. This realization flipped a switch in my brain: it is indefensible to not give time or money to making the world better. The United Nations, nonprofits, and yes, even individual volunteers, contribute to the flourishing of humans. Every bit of work you do may seem inconsequential, but it adds up until we live in a world where since 1990 over 1 billion people have escaped extreme poverty and the number of children who have received vaccines is over 85%. In short, much as discovering the plasticity of the brain makes you realize you can change your habits for the better (at any point in life), taking a data-driven worldview means seeing that humanity as a whole is capable of improvement. People assume that reading the news is a civic duty, but it wasn\\u2019t until I started reading the facts that I began contributing in a meaningful way. Those who incorrectly assume the world is getting worse are probably not among the many people actually making it better. If we want to adopt a fact-based worldview then we need some facts. Fortunately, for those looking to be less wrong about the world, there are more resources for data (often free) than ever before. If you want to replace a news habit (evidence suggests we don\\u2019t get rid of bad habits but replace them with positive ones) or just check the facts, then start with these: These are just a handful of the sites and books which present data about the world as it really is. There will be additional resources provided over the course of the project and I\\u2019m always looking for more recommendations. The Reality Project will be a once-a-week series of articles dedicated to presenting a fact-based picture of the world with an aim to become less wrong about the world with data. Every week we will be exploring a different topic covering the entire range of human activities. This project was borne out of my \\u201cenlightenment\\u201d that began once I started to base my worldview on facts rather than what I was told through the news. Although the intention is not to make you more optimistic, that may be an inevitable side effect of becoming less wrong about the world. There have been many individuals and institutions that have guided me along my journey and will be with us throughout The Reality Project. Prominent among them is the incredible late Hans Rosling who made it his goal to spread a data-centered worldview, and by extension, work to ensure that things continue to get better. His work is carried on by his wife and the Gapminder Foundation. I\\u2019d like to leave you with a signature video from him, one of many inspirations I\\u2019ve had on my path out of the darkness. As always, I welcome feedback, constructive criticism, and, actively encourage dissension throughout the Reality Project. I ask only that rebuttals are rooted in data. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Medium is a great place to write: no distracting features, a large \\u2014 yet civil \\u2014 readership, and, best of all, no advertisements. However, one aspect where it falls short is in the statistics you can see for your articles. Sure, you can go to the stats page, but all you get to see is some plain numbers and a bar chart in an awful shade of green. There\\u2019s no in-depth analysis of any kind and no way to make sense of the data generated by your articles. It\\u2019s as if Medium said: \\u201clet\\u2019s build a great blogging platform, but make it as difficult as possible for writers to get insights from their stats.\\u201d Although I don\\u2019t care about using stats to maximize views (if I wanted to get the most views, all my articles would be 3-minute lists), as a data scientist, I can\\u2019t bear the thought of data going unexamined. Instead of just complaining about the poor state of Medium\\u2019s stats, I decided to do something about it and wrote a Python toolkit to allow anyone to quickly retrieve, analyze, interpret, and make beautiful, interactive plots of their Medium statistics. In this article, I\\u2019ll show how to use the tools, discuss how they work, and we\\u2019ll explore some insights from my Medium story stats. The full toolkit for you to use is on GitHub. You can see a usage Jupyter Notebook on GitHub here (unfortunately interactive plots don\\u2019t work on GitHub\\u2019s notebook viewer) or in full interactive glory on NBviewer here. Contributions to this toolkit are welcome! First, we need to retrieve some stats. When writing the toolkit, I spent 2 hours trying to figure out how to auto login to Medium in Python before deciding on the 15-second solution listed below. If you want to use my data, it\\u2019s already included in the toolkit, otherwise, follow the steps to use your data: This is demonstrated in the following clip: Next, open a Jupyter Notebook or Python terminal in the toolkit\\u2019s medium/ directory and run (again, you can use my included data): This will not only parse stats.html file and extracts all the information, it also goes online to every article, retrieves the entire article and metadata, and stores the results in a dataframe. For my 121 articles, this process took about 5 seconds! Now, we have a dataframe with complete info about our articles: (I\\u2019ve cut off the dataframe for display so there is even more data than shown.) Once we have this information, we can analyze it using any data science methods we know or we can use the tools in the code. Included in the Python toolkit are methods for making interactive plots, fitting the data with machine learning, interpreting relationships and generating future predictions. As a quick example, we can make a heatmap of the correlations in the data: The <tag> columns indicate whether the story has a specific tag. We can see the tag \\u201cTowards Data Science\\u201d has a 0.54 correlation with the number of \\u201cfans\\u201d indicating that attaching this tag to a story is positively correlated with the number of fans (as well as the number of claps). Most of these relationships are obvious (claps is positively correlated with fans) but if you want to maximize story views, you may be able to find some hints here. Another plot we can make in a single line of code is a scatterplot matrix (also affectionately called a \\u201csplom\\u201d) colored by the publication: (These plots are interactive which can be seen in NBviewer here). Before we get back to the analysis (there are a lot more plots to look forward to), it\\u2019s worth briefly discussing how these Python tools get and display all the data. The workhorses of the code are BeautifulSoup, requests, and plotly, which in my opinion, are as important for data science as the well-known pandas + numpy + matplotlib trio (as we\\u2019ll see, it\\u2019s time to retire matplotlib). From a first look at the Medium stats page, it doesn\\u2019t seem very structured. However, hidden beneath every page on the internet is HyperText Markup Language (HTML), a structured language for rendering web pages. Without Python, we might be forced to open up excel and start typing in those numbers (when I was at the Air Force, no joke, this would have been the accepted method) but, thanks to the BeautifulSoup library, we can make use of the structure to extract data. For example, to find the above table within the downloaded stats.html we use: Once we have a soup object, we step through it, at each point getting the data we need (HTML has a hierarchical tree structure referred to as a Document Object Model \\u2014 DOM). From the table, we take out an individual row \\u2014 representing one article \\u2014 and extract a few pieces of data as follows: This might appear tedious, and it is when you have to do it by hand. It involves a lot of using the developer tools in Google Chrome to find the information you want within the HTML. Fortunately, the Python Medium stats toolkit does all this for you behind the scenes. You just need to type two lines of code! From the stats page, the code extracts metadata for each article, as well as the article link. Then, it grabs the article itself (not just the stats) using the requests library and it parses the article for any relevant data, also with BeautifulSoup. All of this is automated in the toolkit, but it\\u2019s worth taking a look at the code. Once you get familiar with these Python libraries, you start to realize how much data there is on the web just waiting for you to grab it. As a side note, the entire code takes about 2 minutes to run sequentially, but since waiting is unproductive, I wrote it to use multiprocessing and reduced the run time to about 10 seconds. The source code for data retrieval is here. This is a highly unscientific chart of my enjoyment of Python plots over time: The plotly library (with the cufflinks wrapper) has made plotting in Python enjoyable once again! It enables single-line-of-code fully-interactive charts that are so easy to make I have vowed to never write another line of matplotlib again. Contrast the two plots below both made with one line of code: On the left is matplotlib's effort\\u2014 a static, boring chart \\u2014 while on the right is plotly's work \\u2014 a nice interactive chart which, critically, lets you make sense of your data quickly. All of the plotting in the toolkit is done with plotly which means much better charts in much less code. What\\u2019s more, plots in the notebook can be opened in the online plotly chart editor so you can add your own touches such as notes and final edits for publication: The analysis code implements univariate linear regressions, univariate polynomial regressions, multivariate linear regressions, and forecasting. This is done with standard data science tooling: numpy, statsmodels, scipy, and sklearn. For the full visualization and analysis code, see this script. Back to the analysis! I usually like to start off by looking at univariate \\u2014 single variables \\u2014 distributions. For this, we can use the following code: Clearly, I should keep publications in \\u201cTowards Data Science\\u201d! Most of my articles that are not in any publication are unlisted meaning they can only be viewed if you have the link (for that you need to follow me on Twitter). Since all of the data is time-based, there is also a method for making cumulative graphs showing your stats piling up over time: Recently, I\\u2019ve had a massive spike in word count, because I released a bunch of articles I\\u2019ve been working on for a while. My views started to take off when I published my first articles on Towards Data Science. (As a note, the views aren\\u2019t quite correct because this assumes that all the views for a given article occur at one point in time, when the article is published. However, this is fine as a first approximation). The scatterplot is a simple yet effective method for visualizing relationships between two variables. A basic question we might want to ask is: does the percentage of people who read an article decrease with article length? The straightforward answer is yes: As the length of the article \\u2014 reading time \\u2014 increases, the number of people who make it through the article clearly decreases and then levels out. With the scatterplot, we can make either axis a log scale and include a third variable on the plot by sizing or coloring the points according to a number or category. This is also done in one line of code: The \\u201cRandom Forest in Python\\u201d article is in many ways an outlier. It has the most views of any of my articles, yet takes 21 minutes to read! Although the reading ratio decreases with the length of the article, does the number of people reading or viewing the article as well? While our immediate answer would be yes, on closer analysis, it seems that the number of views may not decrease with reading time. To determine this, we can use the fitting capabilities of the tools. In this analysis, I limited the data to my articles published in Towards Data Science that are shorter than 5000 words and performed a linear regression of views (dependent variable) onto word count (independent variable). Because views can never be negative, the intercept is set to 0: Contrary to what one might think, as the number of words increases (up to 5000) the number of views also increases! The summary for this fit shows the positive linear relationship and that the slope is statistically significant: There was once a private note left on one of my articles by a very nice lady which said essentially: \\u201cYou write good articles, but they are too long. You should write shorter articles with bullet points instead of complete sentences.\\u201d Now, as a rule of thumb, I assume my readers are smart and can handle complete sentences. Therefore, I politely replied to this women (in bullet points) that I would continue to write articles that are exceedingly long. Based on this analysis, there is no reason to shorten articles (even if my goal were to maximize views), especially for the type of readers who pay attention to Towards Data Science. In fact, every word I add results in 14 more views! We are not limited to regressing one variable onto another in a linear manner. Another method we can use is polynomial regression where we allow higher degrees of the independent variable in our fit. However, we want to be careful as the increased flexibility can lead to overfitting especially with limited data. As a good point to keep in mind: when we have a flexible model, a closer fit to the data does not mean an accurate representation of reality! Using any of the higher-degree fits to extrapolate beyond the data seen here would not be advisable because the predictions can be non-sensical (negative or extremely large). If we look at the statistics for the fits, we can see that the root mean squared error tends to decrease as the degree of the polynomial increases: A lower error means we fit the existing data better, but it does not mean we will be able to accurately generalize to new observations (a point we\\u2019ll see in a little bit). In data science, we want the parsimonious model, that is, the simplest model that is able to explain the data. We can also include more than one variable in our linear fits. This is known as multivariate regression since there are multiple independent variables. There are some independent variables, such as the tags Python and Towards Data Science, that contribute to more fans, while others, such as the number of days spent editing, lead to a lower number of fans (at least according to the model). If you wanted to figure out how to get the most fans, you could use this fit and try to maximize it with the free parameters. The final tools in our toolkit are also my favorite: extrapolations of the number of views, fans, reads, or word counts far into the future. This might be complete nonsense, but that doesn\\u2019t mean it\\u2019s not enjoyable! It also serves to highlight the point that a more flexible fit \\u2014 a higher degree of polynomial \\u2014 does not lead to more accurate generalizations for new data. Looks like I have a lot of work set out ahead of me in order to meet the expected prediction! (The slider on the bottom allows you to zoom in to different places on the graph. You can play around with this in the fully interactive notebook). Getting a reasonable estimate requires adjusting the degree of the polynomial fit. However, because of the limited data, any estimate is likely to break down far into the future. Let\\u2019s do one more extrapolation to see how many reads I can expect: You, my reader, also have your work set out for you! I don\\u2019t think these extrapolations are all that useful but they illustrate important points in data science: making a model more flexible does not mean it will be better able to predict the future, and, all models are approximations based on existing data. The Medium stats Python toolkit is a set of tools developed to allow anyone to quickly analyze their own medium article statistics. Although Medium itself does not provide great insights into your stats, that doesn\\u2019t prevent you from carrying out your own analysis with the right tools! There are few things more satisfying to me than making sense out of data \\u2014 which is why I\\u2019m a data scientist\\u2014 especially when that data is personal and/or useful. I\\u2019m not sure there are any major takeaways from this work \\u2014 besides keep writing for Towards Data Science \\u2014 but using these tools can demonstrate some important data science principles. Developing these tools was enjoyable and I\\u2019m working on making them better. I would appreciate any contributions (honestly, even if it\\u2019s a spelling mistake in a Jupyter Notebook, it helps) so check out the code if you want to help. Since this is my last article of the year, I would like to say thanks for reading \\u2014 no matter how many stats you contributed to the totals, I could not have done this analysis without you! As we enter the new year, keep reading, keep writing code, keep doing data science, and keep making the world better. As always, I welcome feedback and discussion.

Author\\u2019s Note Since August 2017, I have had the privilege of working as a data science researcher with the EDIFES project at Case Western Reserve University. While the name is awkward (as a US Department of Energy project, it has to have an acronym), but the idea is simple: take the traditional time-consuming and expensive in-person building energy audit process and make it virtual using data science techniques. The goal is to greatly reduce the time and cost of e energy audits while increasing their reliability, resulting in lower building carbon footprints and significant savings for companies. We want to make it easy for companies to do well by doing good! As a first step in my involvement with the project, I was given a small subset of building data and told to get familiar with the data by performing a full exploratory data analysis (EDA). An EDA is a great way to gain an intuitive understanding of the data involved in the project. Moving forward, this understanding will be vital as I to know the expected patterns and be able to quickly spot anomalies or interesting trends in the data. Moreover, a full EDA will let me try out some of the functions already developed by the EDIFES team and potentially develop new models. Finally, doing an EDA is enjoyable! There is something almost magical about taking millions of lines of data and crafting a single chart to explain all the trends, or making a model that predicts the future with astonishing accuracy. This will be the first in a three part series (with a bonus fourth article entirely devoted to machine learning!). Although promising multiple parts usually leads to disappointment when the author fails to deliver (looking at you George RR Martin), take heart in the knowledge that part 2 is already complete and part 3 is well under way! If you decide to stick with me for the whole journey, you will be treated to the wonders of the R programming language, Python, Tableau, machine learning with Scikit-learn, and maybe even some deep learning with Tensorflow! All of these tools are vital to data scientists, and I hope this may spark some interest in anyone looking to get into this exciting (and high-paying) field. As always, I welcome any feedback (email wjk68@case.edu) and encourage everyone to check out the whole project on GitHub. Problem Statement An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of the electricity consumption patterns of a building by documenting incoming and outgoing energy flows. When done correctly, energy audits can significantly increase the overall efficiency of a building, thereby reducing electricity costs and greenhouse gas emissions. However, traditional physical building energy audits are resource intensive in terms of both time and cost. In-person audits require a team of auditors to travel to a building and perform a series of tests and inspections with specialized equipment to determine the efficiency of a building and identify areas for improvement. In addition to the resource costs of a physical audit, assessments can vary significantly between auditing teams, raising into doubt any economic benefit of an in-person audit. Real concrete gains in building energy use are possible, as the US Department of Energy estimates that building efficiency could increase by 30% by 20301 implementing existing technologies. However, it is clear that physical energy audits are not the optimal tool for identifying efficiency improvement opportunities. EDIFES Approach EDIFES: Energy Diagnostic Investigator for Efficiency Savings is an ARPA-E funded project [1] jointly undertaken by the Great Lakes Energy Institute and CWRU that aims to develop a software tool for performing virtual energy audits. The overall objective of the project, under the direction of Professors Alexis Abramson and Roger French, is to eliminate the need for physical audits by determining areas for efficiency improvements using only overall building electricity consumption data and building metadata (location and square footage). Part of this process is developing a set of building markers from the electricity data, such as building occupancy schedule and HVAC on/off cycle times, that can be used to characterize a building. [2] In the first phase of the project, EDIFES has partnered with several companies to gain access to building data, perform preliminary analyses of those buildings, and receive feedback on the accuracy of the report. [3] I will be exploring a dataset of time-series electricity consumption data from 8 Progressive office buildings. In addition, the building information contains metadata allowing the weather data associated with each building to be obtained from solarGIS. The data has already been cleaned by members of the EDIFES team and the corresponding weather data is attached to the time-series for each building. Each building is contained in a separate csv file. In the initial cleaning process performed by the EDIFES team [4], 2 of the office\\nbuildings did not pass the data quality standards established by the project because of issues with anomalies and missing values. As these buildings have already been partially modeled by the team, I will focus on exploring questions that might have been beyond the scope of the initial EDIFES investigation. Building Metadata The building metadata contains city, square footage, and annual consumption which is primarily useful for obtaining the corresponding weather data from solarGIS. Buildings with Reference number 92 and 95 were not analyzed by EDIFES because they did not pass the data quality standards of the project. A brief explanation of the metadata variables follows: \\u2022 Ref: reference number\\n\\u2022 Location: City, State\\n\\u2022 Square Footage: Size of building in ft\\u02c62\\n\\u2022 Climate Zone: Koppen-Geiger climate zone classification\\n\\u2022 Annual Consumption: Total consumption per year in kWh Energy and Weather Data The energy data for 8 of the buildings has already been cleaned and each building is in a separate csv file with associated weather information. Each row of the csv data files contains one time interval of fifteen minutes. The columns contain the energy consumption and weather data associated with that building and timestamp. The csv file for each building contains the following columns. Not all of the variables were examined in the initial modeling of the data by the EDIFES team. The following variables were of primary interest to the team on the first pass through the data. \\u2022 timestamp: gives the date and time for the energy measurement in fifteen minute intervals\\n\\u2022 elec_cons: the raw electricity consumption data (kWh)\\n\\u2022 elec_cons_imp: 1 or 0 marker if the data was linearly imputed\\n\\u2022 power_dem: difference in power (kW) between measurements\\n\\u2022 biz_day: business day or not (accounts for holidays)\\n\\u2022 day_of_week: relatively self-explanatory\\n\\u2022 week_day_end: weekday or weekend\\n\\u2022 num_time: number of hours since the start of day\\n\\u2022 temp: most correlated weather variable with energy consumption\\n\\u2022 rh: relative humidity, the second highest positively correlated weather variable with energy consumption\\n\\u2022 forecast: final cleaned energy consumption with anomalies removed and missing data imputed using a\\ncustom function\\n\\u2022 anom_missed_flag: marker that tells if forecast energy had to be corrected from the raw number. There would be two reasons for the raw data to be corrected:the data was missing, or the data was anomalous (an outlier). Although not all of the variables were used in the modeling by the EDIFES team, I will keep all of the weather data to try and find relationships that may have gone overlooked. Data Cleaning The data has been completely cleaned. Team members used the tsoutliers R package to identify and correct anomalies. Missing data was either linearly imputed (if fewer than 4 missing points in a row) or imputed using a custom function developed for the project. Assembling the dataframes will be as simple as reading in the data from the correct csv file. I expect to have one dataframe for each building rather than collecting them into one massive data structure. The EDIFES team is more concerned with analyzing buildings individually rather than performing comparisons and the best strategy is to perform the EDA one building at a time. With all this beautiful tidy data at my hands, what questions should I ask? My primary interest is correlations between weather and energy consumption. As building energy consumption can be strongly dependent on the weather, this research holds potential for identifying opportunities for significant energy savings. In particular, I want to identify what weather conditions result in higher energy usage. This information could then be used to inform building energy managers that their building could be optimized to their climate or could be used to develop a more efficient heating/cooling schedule in anticipation of forecasted weather. Furthermore, if it were possible to develop a model that accurately predicted energy consumption for the next day based on the weather forecast, this could be used to derive the building energy schedule in order to prepare for the weather conditions. I would like to see if a machine learning model could accurately predict the next day\\u2019s energy consumption based on current/forecasted weather conditions. With the addition of keras into R, it is now possible to relatively quickly develop a deep or recurrent neural network. The weather neural network would take in the previous day\\u2019s weather and electricity consumption as labels and try to predict the next day\\u2019s electricity consumption as the target. A recurrent neural network with LSTM cells would be an ideal model for this task because it has the capability to \\u201cremember\\u201d previous inputs, which is vital in time series (or any sequence) analysis.\\nI am also interested in comparitive analysis. Although I will look at the buildings individually, it might be useful to compare buildings with similar characteristics located in different climate zones. Moreover, I want\\nto determine how a \\u201cgood\\u201d building performs with regards to energy efficiency. I think these questions could be answered by comparing the buildings and using average building energy use statistics from\\nother data sources. Finally (at least for now), I would like to apply the next series of 10 building markers currently being developed to these buildings. Studying the feedback provided by Progressive with regards to the first 10 buildings markers was a good learning experience because it showed what the team was able to correctly predict, and what parts of the models need to be adjusted. A similar prediction \\u2014 feedback cycle will take place with the second set of 10 markers, and it will show what we can and cannot understand about\\na building from a single stream of data. This would involve using code currently under development by EDIFES members. I hope to develop a pipeline that will automatically run the 10 building marker for a building. For the first 10 markers, the EDIFES team developed a script that took in a cleaned building dataset and generated a complete report. The script will\\nneed to be applicable to any cleaned data and not only the dataset I have for this project. Based on these three paths of exploration, I formulated the following set of 6 questions: 1. Which weather variables are most correlated with energy consumption and what is the physical explanation behind this? 2. Can the current day\\u2019s weather data be used to predict tomorrow\\u2019s energy consumption? 3. Controlling for building size, which climate zone is the most energy intensive? 4. Are these buildings \\u201cgood\\u201d in terms of energy efficiency? What does \\u201cgood\\u201d mean in this context (i.e. how can it be quantified)? 5. Can the next 10 markers accurately characterize these buildings?\\\\ 6. Based on the answers to the previous 5 questions, are there concrete recommendations for building managers to reduce energy use? I expect these questions to change and adapt over the course of this exploration. EDA is an iterative process, and trying to answer one question can lead to 5 additional queries. Moreover, all data has fundamental limitations and may not be appropriate to answer the initial questions. This is not an undesirable situation because the heart of EDA is to learn what your data can teach you before employing more sophisticated statistical methods to test hypotheses. In the words of John Tukey (a mathematician who developed the FFT and boxplot): Yeah, that\\u2019s great and all, but show us some plots! First up, I wanted to show the location and the associated climate zone. This demonstrates the diversity in climate zones. This visual was made using Tableau, a powerful visualization software (and as students, we can get the professional edition for free). Part of data science is using the appropriate tools for the situation, and if you have clean, tidy data and want to make a decent looking map in five minutes, then Tableau is the best tool for the task! (If you have a csv file and are thinking about making a plot in Excel,\\nstop, do yourself a favor, and open Tableau so you can make a professional looking chart.) As can be seen, 6 different climate zones are represented meaning there is considerable variability for comparison purposes. Now we can go to the world of R for a few sample plots of the energy consumption and weather data. These plots look at one of the buildings in Phoenix, AZ. The first plot shows the raw energy consumption data. The next figure shows the cleaned energy consumption for the same building. These graphs are somewhat unrefined and cluttered, but they primarily serve to demonstrate the cleaned data does not contain the anomalies or missing data that are present in the raw data. A better visualization is to plot the mean daily energy consumption over the extent of the data. This smooths out the intraday variability inherent when taking observations every 15 minutes. As expected for Phoenix, AZ, in the American southwest, energy consumption rises during the summer months and falls during the winter months. It will be interesting to see how much of a difference a \\u201ccool\\u201d summer or a \\u201cwarm\\u201d winter has on energy consumption. The next two plots look at possible correlations between energy use and weather conditions. As a hypothesis, I would expect electricity consumption to increase with an increase in temperature and decrease with a decrease in relative humidity. The first plot shows the relationship between average daily electricity consumption and average daily temperature. The next plot shows the relationship between average daily relative humidity and average daily energy consumption. Finally, to quantify all relationships between weather variables and energy consumption, I can generate the entire correlation matrix. To capture the relationships, this code calculates the Pearson correlation coefficient, a measure of the linear relationship between two variables. It ranges from +1 indicating a positive perfectly linear relationship to -1, indicating a negative perfectly linear relationship. The image below shows illustrative values of the Pearson correlation coefficient. In the correlation plot below, forecast refers to the final cleaned energy value. Looking down the forecast column shows first the distribution of the cleaned energy (as a histogram) and then three scatterplots showing the trends between energy consumption and temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed respectively. Moving rightward across the forecast row are the correlation coefficients of the weather variables with energy. The stars represent the significance of the relationship with three stars indicating a strong linear relationship. There are definitely hints of meaningful relationships between forecast (the final cleaned energy) and temperature and relative humidity. There does not appear to be much of a relationship between wind speed and energy consumption, but the possibility cannot yet be ruled out with these preliminary visualizations! This first report identified the importance of the project and approach of the EDIFES team, posed a few questions to guide the analysis, and explored some preliminary relationships quantitatively and visually. My exploration of the data will be guided by a set of six initial questions with more to come as I start a thorough examination of the data. Finally, I have made some preliminary charts of the data and have identified possible relationships for further investigation. See you in Report 2!

Author\\u2019s Note: This is part two of a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of eight office buildings as part ofthe EDIFES Project at Case Western Reserve University. Part One, where I explain the background, take a look at the data, and make some exploratory plots, can be found here. For those who need a refresher, EDIFES (or the Energy Diagnostic Investigator for Efficiency Savings) is a US Department of Energy project (hence the convoluted acronym) to develop a virtual energy audit platform. Energy audits identify inefficiencies in a building\\u2019s electricity usage, and are typically done at the physical building by a trained team. There are a number of drawbacks to this approach, and a virtual audit that can be done without ever setting foot in a building will reduce the time and cost of the procedure while increasing the accuracy. This will lead to improved economic and environmental benefits, making it easier for companies to do well by doing good. I have included some of the code used to produce the plots and analyses, and the full code can be found on GitHub. As always, I welcome feedback (especially constructive criticism) and can be reached at wjk68@case.edu. Before we can get started with any plots, we have to know what data we are dealing with. There are two categories of data available for this project: metadata, which is information about the buildings themselves, and individual building data, which lists the electricity usage and weather data for each building in 15-minute intervals for a period of at least one year. The metadata is presented below. Annual consumption is in kWh and the climate zones are Koppen Geiger. The two buildings with no name could not be analyzed because poor data quality. This left us with eight office buildings in six climate zones to explore. Each building has its own individual energy and weather file. The rows of each file are the observations every fifteen minutes with the variables forming the columns. Following are all the variables for each building: Not all of these variables turn out to be useful and the most relevant are: \\u2022 timestamp: gives the date and time for the energy measurement in fifteen minute intervals \\u2022 elec_cons: the raw electricity consumption data (kWh) \\u2022 biz_day: business day or not (accounts for holidays) \\u2022 day_of_week: relatively self-explanatory \\u2022 week_day_end: weekday or weekend \\u2022 num_time: number of hours since the start of day \\u2022 ghi: global horizontal irradiance, generally positively correlated with energy consumption during the summer \\u2022 temp: temperature, generally positively correlated with energy consumption during the summer \\u2022 rh: relative humidity The forecast column (named because the energy use has been \\u201cforecasted\\u201d using imputation methods) is the electricity consumption we use for analysis. The raw electricity consumption has anomalies and missing points, and these are corrected before any summaries/plots can be made. I won\\u2019t go into details here, but that involves setting outliers/anomalies to zero, and then imputing the zero values based on the surrounding values (either using a linear method, or diffusion indices). For example, if we have a 0 value in between a 5 and a 7, then the corrected value would be 6. To make things easier, I have renamed the forecast column to energy in the plots. Now that the tedious (but extremely necessary) business of outlining our variables and making sure the data is clean has been completed, we can move on to the enjoyable part, making graphs and exploring trends! The main question I wanted to explore in this report was: What weather and time conditions are most correlated with energy consumption, and will it be possible to create a model to predict the energy use based on the conditions? The second part of that question is mostly saved for part three, but we can definitely take care of the first with some plots! In the preliminary charts from part one, I noticed there appeared to be patterns that repeated on a daily, weekly, and seasonal timescale as well as overall trends, and it is worth examining each of these in turn. Overall Trends First, we need to get an overview of an entire dataset. Plots with every single point every 15-minutes are a little overwhelming, so it\\u2019s better to take daily averages. Examples of running this function on three buildings (Christmas colors in these plots was not intentional!): There are a number of noticeable trends in these plots. For all the buildings,\\nenergy consumption increases during the the summer which agrees with intuition. The largest source of office building energy consumption tends to be the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system, which will see more use during the summer months for southern climates. Kansas City, Las Vegas, and Phoenix experience hot summers and hence will see an increase in energy consumption in the summer due to air conditioning use. The buildings in Las Vegas and Phoenix have a decrease in energy consumption during the winter because these cities experience mild winters which do not necessitate energy-intensive heating. Meanwhile, the building in Kansas City does not exhibit the same large decrease during the winter. Energy consumption for this building has two peaks, with one occurring during late summer, and the other occurring during late winter, probably because of the need for cooling during the summer and heating during the winter. Monthly Trends Now that we can see what is happening on the long term, how does each month look? The next plots show a boxplot with average daily energy consumption for each month of the year. Boxplots are a great way to visualize data because they show the median (middle value), the range of the values (the box is the Interquartile Range), and outliers. We can see both the location and spread of the data. This code creates the boxplots where each box is computed based on the daily averages for the month. The same yearly behavior is observed as before, with an increase in energy use during the summer for the Las Vegas and Phoenix buildings, and two yearly peaks in consumption for the Kansas building. The Kansas building has significantly more outlying points (shown in red) during the spring months indicating that daily energy consumption varies significantly during these months. This is not unexpected as some springs may be much colder than others, necessitating heating. Weekly and Daily Trends The last major repeating patterns observed in the data occur on a daily and weekly level with the exact pattern dependent on the season. There are many different ways to visualize these trends but I found the best way was to show all of the seasons on the same plot. The following code shows average energy consumption over the course of a day for each day of the week with the lines colored by season. There is a ton of information compressed into these single images! All buildings exhibit the highest energy consumption during the summer and the buildings in Phoenix and Las Vegas have the lowest energy consumption during the winter. However, the Kansas City building\\u2019s minimum energy consumption is during the spring. We can also see all these buildings have a typical schedule of high electricity use during the workweek, and a significant drop on the weekends, indicative of the normal office building occupancy schedule. The final aspect to notice is energy consumption generally peaks during the mid-afternoon. There is a noticeable increase in the morning, as building HVAC systems are turned on in preparation for the workday, and then the energy use falls before rising into the afternoon. The systems are typically shut down at the end of the working day, and we can infer the working hours by examining the significant increase (start of work) and significant decrease (end of work) in energy. Finally, I wanted to convey this information in a more dynamic fashion. After searching for a method to do this, I saw that R can be used to create animation swith gganimate. I created an animated version of the same plots as above where each line is a different season and the frames are days of the week. We now have a pretty good understanding of the typical patterns of office building energy use. Office buildings generally experience a peak in consumption during the afternoon, have higher electricity usage during the work week, and depending on the geographic location, will exhibit different trends across seasons. From these patterns, we can determine useful info such as occupancy schedule and operating hours. To determine opportunities to increase efficiency, we could compare the actual occupancy schedule with that observed from the energy usage and see if there is a mismatch. Maybe the HVAC starts two hours earlier than it needs to, or there might be an unexpected increase on the weekends due to a system malfunction. It\\u2019s often surprising how little building owners know about the energy use patterns of their buildings and if we point out the inconsistencies, they can be addressed to both save money and reduce the building\\u2019s carbon footprint. Once we have observed the typical patterns of energy use, the next question is to ask what weather conditions might cause consumption to increase or decrease beyond the normal range? To address that query, we will mainly be relying on a simple measure called the Pearson Correlation Coefficient, or r-value. This statistic ranges from -1 to +1 and tells us the direction and strength of a linear relationship between two variables. Two variables that are perfectly positively linearly correlated will have an r-value of +1, while two variables with a perfectly negative linear correlation will have an r-value of -1. As an example, if temperature and energy have an r-value of 0.8, then this means that as temperature increases, the energy also tends to increase in a linear fashion. The r-value does not tell us the slope of this relationship, only whether it is linear and positive/negative. Once we have established a linear relationship, we can use modeling to find out the slope, or how large of an effect changing one variable will have on another. Examples of different r-values are shown below. We can look at actual tables of the correlation coefficients, but I find that rather dull. A visual representation is much better at conveying relative differences and is easier to understand at a glance. A quick method to create correlation plots is using ggpairs, a function in the GGally package in R. These show correlations between all variables for a single building (in Phoenix, AZ) in summer and winter. On the lower left are scatterplots between each pair of variables, and the right shows the numerical value of r. The diagonals are density plots of the variables because the correlation between a variable and itself is always 1! To determine the value of the correlation coefficient between variables, pick one variable, and move down the row to another variable for comparison. For instance, in the summer plot, in the top right corner, we can see that energy has a 0.125 correlation with ghi (global horizontal irradiance, a measure of the intensity of sunlight hitting a surface). This is a slightly positive linear correlation and if we move to the bottom left corner, we observe the relationship in a scatterplot of ghi vs energy. The strongest correlation with energy during the summer is temperature at a value of 0.575. These agrees with our intuition: when it is warmer during the summer, a building has to use more air conditioning and hence more electricity. What if we want to look at the correlation values for all of the weather variables with energy for all of the buildings? That\\u2019s a lot of information for one plot, but it is doable with one of my favorite graphs: the correlation heatmap. There are built-in libraries in R for making heatmaps, but I decided to create my own starting with the basic geom_tile() in ggplot2. In these plots, the color corresponds to the value of r, making it very easy to spot the anomalous building in the summer graph! The building in Portland, OR displays nearly the exact opposite correlation from all of the other buildings for every weather variable. Instead of an increase in energy use when the temperature rises during the summer, this building has a decrease in temperature. Likewise, all other buildings have a decrease in energy use when the relative humidity increases except for Portland! I notified the team and we got in contact with the building owners to see what was going on. It turns out they had no explanation for us and could not point out anything that made this building different. Our two hypotheses were one, that the building had solar power, which produced more energy as the temperature rose because the sun would be out (and the irradiance would rise) and thus the building would use less electricity from the grid, or two, that the electricity meter timestamp was off by some fixed amount. Our best guess was the meter was 12 hours out sync with the real time, but we have not had a chance to discuss this with the utility. The building owner has confirmed she is not aware of any solar panels and I went so far as to look on Google Maps at the building to see if there were some renegade solar panels anywhere near the building. Alas, I could not find any and the mystery remains. If you have any additional ideas, feel free to contact us! A point of interest from the winter heatmap is that some of the correlation values are positive for temperature and some are negative. This is actually what the team told me to expect because during the winter, buildings with electrical heating will need to use more electricity as the temperature declines, leading to a negative coefficient. However, buildings with gas heating or not heating at all, will not use more electricity as the temperature declines and may have a positive or near zero r value. This is a fact I could have realized beforehand, but it took actually digging through the data and creating some visuals to make the point clear. Note: If you run the function for the first heatmap (plot_heatmap), you will see an awful plot that is barely comprehensible. I decided this was unacceptable and used the second function (plot_final_heatmap) to improve on the first. I enjoy the iterative process of data visualization and spending the extra time to make presentable plots. You can communicate the same info in a table or basic graph, but people are more likely to pay attention if you give them the message in something they will want to look at! Visualizing Relationships After identifying relationships, the next step is generally to quantify them by creating models that let us see how much a change in one variable affects the value of another. That will be the sole focus of report three, and for now, I want to take a quick look at how these relationships play out. The following code creates a plot of daily average energy use and daily average temperature during the summer for the building in Phoenix. The figure illustrates how temperature and daily energy use generally track one another. The correlation coefficient in this case was 0.77. It appears that the temperature leads the energy consumption, or in other words, the temperature rises and then the energy consumption rises which demonstrates the concept of thermal mass. This is the thermodynamic equivalent of inertia, which is says that for two objects going the same speed, it will be more difficult to slow down the heavier object. Likewise, a building with a greater thermal mass will take longer to change temperature, whether that is an increase or decrease. There are other variables at play here besides just temperature that we should take into account, but overall the trend shows that temperature and energy use are positively correlated for this building during the summer. An animated version of this plot for one week is the title image of the post. To see a negative correlation, we can look at the relationship between daily average relative humidity and energy consumption. The relative humidity has a -0.44 relationship with energy use. This is a bit more difficult to spot in the graph because it is not as strong as the temperature relationship, but we can see that the two lines tend to travel in opposite directions. What we have learned so far is there are many time patterns and weather correlations in the energy data. Now, the question is, can we create a machine learning model that will be able to predict the energy consumption from the weather and time conditions? Part three will go into detail about the modeling process, but I wanted to show the evaluation results of several different models here. The overall objective is to make a model that can predict six months worth of energy consumption given the weather and time information. The model will be trained on all the data except for the last six months, and then tested on the held out data. During training, the model is able to see both the weather and time variables (known as features in machine learning) and the energy consumption (called the target). The goal of training is for the model to learn the mapping between features and the target. The model tries to figure out how much energy will be used during a 15-minute interval based on the weather, time of day, day of the week, and so one. Then, to assess the accuracy of the model, it will have to predict electricity consumption on the test set from only the features (it is not allowed to ever see the test set targets because that would be cheating!). Creating an accurate model requires lots of engineering, and we first need to choose a type of model before we can delve into optimizing that model. To cover a wide range of model complexity, I choose three algorithms for evaluation: linear regression, support vector machine regression, and random forest regression. If you\\u2019re not familiar with these methods, it\\u2019s not that important for this part of the report, and they will get a full explanation in the next part. For now, just know that linear regression tries to fit a straight line to the data, a support vector machine transforms the features into a higher dimension (yes, it is pretty much magic) and then fits a line to the data, and the random forest is composed of hundreds of decision trees. A single decision tree is basically a flowchart of questions. Starting at the root, you follow the branches down, answering each question until you arrive at an answer and a random forest works by taking a vote of many of these trees to find the average prediction, which is going to be closer to the true value on average than any one particular answer. A decision tree used to determine if an applicant should be approved for a loan based on their info is presented below. Start at the top, answer each question based on the individual\\u2019s background, and eventually you arrive at a decision! Model Evaluation With details to come in part three, here I will just show the results of evaluation. The models were compared to one another by splitting the data into a random training and testing set (using the same set for each model), training the model, testing the model, and comparing models using several metrics. The data preparation was completed in R, and the actual implementation of the algorithms was done in Python. The metrics chosen are presented below: 1. rmse: root mean square error, the square root of the sum of the deviations squared divided by the number of observations. This is a useful metric because it has the same units (kWh) as the true value so it can serve as a measure of how many kWh the average estimate is from the known true target. The rmse is dependent on the magnitude of the target variable and is often normalized for model evaluation. 2. MAPE: mean average percentage error: the absolute value of the error for each prediction divided by the target value and multiplied by 100. The percentage accuracy can be found by subtracting the MAPE from 100%. 3. R-squared: the percentage of the variation in the dependent variable explained by the independent variables in the model. In other words, with an r-squared of 0.6, that means our model can explain 60% of the variability in the energy consumption from the weather and time variables. A lower MAPE is better because it is the percentage error, and a higher r-squared is better because it means the model captures the relationships in the data more completely. The MAPE and R-Squared results are presented below the code used to generate them: These results show that the random forest is without a doubt the winner! Next steps for the random forest are tuning the hyperparameters (adjusting the settings to maximize performance) and then assessing how well it can predict six months of energy use. To give you a little idea of what to expect in the next part, the following graphs show an entire dataset with the predictions of the random forest overlaid, and then a typical weekly prediction. The Random Forest shows much promise for prediction, but there is definitely some work to do! That however can wait until the next part\\u2026 After an enjoyable exploration of the eight building energy datasets we can draw the following conclusions: Thanks for making it to the end. As a special bonus, here is another animated plot: See you in part 3! A practical implementation of data science for the cause of improving building energy efficiency. Author\\u2019s Note: Following is the final report for my senior project at Case Western Reserve University. The work presented here was part of my ongoing involvement with the EDIFES research project conducted with the Great Lakes Energy Institute and the university. (Numbers in [brackets] refer to references after the report) A major part of the global attempt to combat climate change is improving energy efficiency. Commercial buildings present an attractive target for these efforts because up to thirty percent of the energy they consume is wasted. These losses are especially egregious because once the issues have been identified, they can be eliminated using existing technology. Identification of energy inefficiencies in commercial buildings has traditionally relied on physical audits in which a team of trained auditors travels to a building to perform a series of tests with specialized equipment. However, these in-person energy audits are resource-intensive in time and cost, and audits performed by different teams can result in varying conclusions, casting doubt on the economic benefits of the procedure. The Energy Diagnostic Investigator for Efficiency Savings (EDIFES) Project will upend the traditional audit process by using data science techniques to conduct virtual energy audits. A virtual energy audit will be cheaper, more reliable, and quicker than its physical counterpart, lowering the barrier for a building owner to find and correct energy wastes. The objective of Project EDIFES is to provide virtual energy audits as a service using a data science platform to reduce the time and cost of an energy audit while increasing the accuracy and economic/environmental benefits. The work documented herein comprises a small part of the EDIFES project. The primary goal of this work was to improve a set of building markers under development by the EDIFES team [1] and apply them to a set of several hundred buildings as a cross-sectional analysis. As part of any complex project, the focus of this work changed over the course of the semester in response to the needs of the team. Therefore, this report encompasses not only work relating to building markers, but also an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of eight office buildings, an attempt at using machine learning/statistical methods for building energy prediction/forecasting, and an extensive effort to improve code documentation and enforce standards to make EDIFES a sustainable project. As of the end of this semester, significant progress has been made on all fronts: the first twenty building markers have been refined and integrated into an automatic report generation R markdown script; the cross-sectional study has validate several markers and shown others require adjustment, the EDA revealed insights into patterns of building energy use and correlations with weather conditions; and the machine learning prediction with a random forest regression model was successful. Overall, progress documented in this report encompasses a wide range of domains, which is indicative of an exploratory data project in which members must take on multiple roles to form a cohesive team. Findings and conclusions of this report may appear disparate, but all work complete this semester is encompassed by the overarching goal of developing a platform for virtual energy audits. Up to 30% of the energy used by commercial buildings in the United States is wasted [2]. Nearly all waste is a result of preventable causes including inefficient heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) scheduling, improper insulation, exterior lights that are uncoordinated with natural lighting cycles, or oversized equipment. The barrier to fixing these inefficiencies is not technological, as solutions already exist, but rather identification of savings opportunities. An energy audit is the accepted solution to this problem and involves inspection and analysis of energy flows into and out of a building [3]. Typical commercial in-person energy audits require sending a team of auditors to the physical building location to perform a series of tests. These tests use a range of techniques and equipment, from blower checks of window and door seals to infrared camera scans of rooms to determine where a building is squandering electricity. Due to the human labor and equipment required, these physical energy audits carry a considerable cost, up to $15,000, and have a turn-around time of weeks or months [4]. Moreover, the recommendations for the building owner can vary considerably depending on the auditing team. These factors combine to reduce the economic value of an energy audit. EDIFES, a joint project between Case Western Reserve University and the Great Lakes Energy Institute [5], aims to address these limitations by performing virtual energy audits that do not require setting foot in a building. To reduce requirements on the building owner, she/he will only need to provide EDIFES with the square footage and location of the building. The electricity usage is obtained directly from the utility company, typically in 15-minute energy consumption (in kWh) for at least one past year. The weather data corresponding to each building is retrieved from solarGIS [6] and merged with the energy information. The objective of the EDIFES project is a software platform that will automatically receive electricity data and metadata, clean and analyze the data, and produce a human-understandable report with recommendations for efficiency improvements. EDIFES will reduce the time and cost burden of conducting energy audits and consequently will increase the economic benefit of this critical procedure. EDIFES began as an exploratory data project to investigate the possibility of deriving insights from only the raw electricity consumption of a building [7]. Progress has continued steadily since the project\\u2019s inception and at the start of the fall 2017 semester, the following had been completed. A pipeline was developed for cleaning the electricity data and matching it to the corresponding weather data to create a single structure (an R dataframe) containing all relevant information for each building. This by itself was a significant achievement as data cleaning and structuring makes up the bulk of a data analysis, and creating an automatic process for these steps is critical to the feasibility of performing virtual energy audits at scale. Additionally, twenty building markers, functions that identify characteristics of a building to build an energy profile, were developed, although the majority had not been thoroughly tested and were in need of proper documentation. These building markers form the basis for the auditing procedure and like the cleaning process will need to be automatically applied to a building without manual labor. Finally, a significant amount of research went into developing a method for disaggregating individual building systems (mainly HVAC) from the overall energy consumption [8]. The most common approach surveyed in the literature [9] [10] was the Factorial Hidden Markov Chain (FHMC) algorithm. However, these studies were conducted with high-frequency data and typically had access to sub-metered information for each system, both benefits EDIFES will have to do without. Prior EDIFES team members worked extensively on the FHMC method, and investigations have also been made into thermodynamic approaches. Finally, team members have examined wavelet transformations and diffusion indices as a means for forecasting building energy use and assessing the impact of a building retrofit. The primary objective of the semester project was to improve the building marker functions, automate the process of running the markers on a building, and perform a cross-sectional study of the markers on 750 + buildings. The study required the markers to be in working order, and priority was placed on marker improvement and organization before a larger-scale analysis could occur. A secondary task was to perform a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) of eight office buildings to gain familiarity with the domain and identify any patterns. An additional exploratory task was an attempt to develop a predictive model that can infer the energy use of a building given the time and the weather. The goal of the predictive model is to achieve an r-squared value of at least 0.85 when predicting electricity consumption for a period of six months. During the course of work on these objectives, an additional concern arose, the sustainability of code developed for the project. Project EDIFES relies solely on undergraduate and graduate students to write code, which means it must deal with inevitable graduations and team members arriving and leaving. The result of turnover is an unorganized code base with uncommented, barely comprehensible scripts. If the original author is not present to explain what she was trying to do, it is near impossible to modify or fix these functions. Therefore, a major focus of this semester was to enforce standards both for writing code and for tracking task assignments. The code and packages used by the team must be streamlined so they can be used as a tool for the data analysis and not be an impediment. The objectives of this project were fluid over the course of the semester, but significant progress was ultimately made in all aspects. The procedure for performing a virtual energy audit consists of three distinct steps [7]: 1. Obtain electricity and weather data in a clean and standard format 2. Analyze the data using statistical methods encoded in R functions 3. Report results and develop recommendations for the building owner The process for retrieving, cleaning, and structuring the data was fully developed by the start of this semester. Raw electricity data for a building is obtained through the utility, at a frequency of fifteen minutes or greater, and comprising at least one previous year of continuous data. The raw data goes into the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS), a file storage system designed for warehousing massive amounts of data in multiple locations for redundancy [11]. After acquisition, the data passes through a set of cleaning methods. First, anomalous data points are identified using the tsoutliers R package and set to NA for later imputation. Breaks of four or fewer missing/NA points in a row are linearly imputed from the data before and after, while longer gaps are filled in using the diffusion indices method typically used for time-series forecasting. All cleaning is done using the BuildingRClean package developed by the EDIFES team. The cleaned data must pass a set of data quality criteria and receives a grade based on the percentage of anomalies, percentage of missing/zeros, and maximum stretch of days with no data. Datasets receiving too low of a grade cannot be analyzed at an acceptable level of certainty and are discarded. Passing electricity data is matched to weather data obtained from solarGIS based on the latitude and longitude provided by the building owner. The merged time-series data is moved into HBase, which is a subset of HDFS holding only high quality, analysis-ready datasets. From HBase, the data can be accessed using the cradletools package developed in the Solar Degradation and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) laboratory [12]. Eventually, the entire ingestion and cleaning process will be automated, but it currently requires several manual commands. Nonetheless, a dataset can be acquired, cleaned, validated, and registered in HBase within a matter of hours. All steps of the process are performed on the CWRU High Power Computing (HPC) cluster due to the computational resources required to analyze the data. Figure 1 provides an overview of the data ingestion and processing pipeline. Analysis of the data, step two, is the heart of the EDIFES project and the focus of the majority of current work. This step is built on applying building markers, a set of functions that identify building energy characteristics. Through these functions, a building energy \\u201cprofile\\u201d is created which can be used to compare buildings and assess if a building is operating near peak efficiency. Building markers cover a wide range of operating features. Examples of markers in use are baseload to peak energy ratio, energy pattern snapshot, HVAC schedule (on/off times), and building occupancy patterns. Results are presented in both graphical and tabular form allowing for quick intuitive explanations as well as quantification and comparison. Figure 2 presents graphical results from the heating type and weekly clustering markers. In order to validate the accuracy of building markers, EDIFES has collaborated with several companies to submit reports and receive feedback on the accuracy of reports. Based on the results, the functions are then updated in an iterative manner. Many of the functions receive minor modifications on a daily basis and current efforts have focused on improving accuracy and understandability to future developers. An additional aspect of the analysis is disaggregating individual systems from overall energy consumption, allowing building owners to discover precisely which equipment uses the most energy. Finally, the value-added part of the data analysis is examining the effects of efficiency changes to a building in order to quantify effects on energy consumption. At the end of a report, a building owner will want to know exactly how she can improve her building, and how much she can expect to save as a result. The initial two steps of the process comprise the technical aspects of the project. Therefore, although reporting may seem to be the simplest part as it does not involve any calculations, it is the most critical aspect of the project because it is the only part of the audit that will be visible to the customer. The reports EDIFES has provided to commercial partners for validation have been relatively simple explanations of results with a few visuals, but the final reports will need to be polished with production-level graphics and a list of concrete recommendations for a building owner with quantified savings attached to each suggestion. Progress on reporting has been far behind that for the first two steps if only because there is nothing to report until the analysis is complete. Moving forward, reporting, and the presentation format will become a major focus. A number of machine learning and statistical methods are presented in this report. \\u00a7 Linear Regression: The objective of linear regression is to create a linear mapping between the response and the explanatory variables. In the case of EDIFES, the response is the energy consumption and the explanatory variables are the weather and time readings for each interval. The response is a linearly weighted combination of all the explanatory variables: Where y, the response, is a linear combination of the features, xn, multiplied by their respective weights, wn. The benefits of a linear model are that it can be interpreted because the weight represents the change in the response due to a unit change in the input. For example, a weight of three for temperature would indicate that a 1\\u02da C increase in temperature results in a three kWh increase in energy consumption over the interval of time. Linear models are often the first model used in any analysis because they have no hyperparameters, are quick to train, and the results can be understood in terms of physical quantities [13]. \\u00a7 Support Vector Machine Regression: A support vector machine (SVM) regressor is the most complicated and the least interpretable of the models explored in this report. SVMs can be used for both classification and regression and operate based on finding a hyperplane to separate classes. The concept is that any decision boundary becomes linear in a high enough dimensional space [14]. For example, a linear decision boundary in three-dimensional space is a plane. The SVM projects the features of the observations into a higher dimensional space using a kernel, or a transformation of the data. The model then finds the plane that best separates the data by maximizing the margin, the minimum distance between the nearest member of each class and the decision boundary. The support vectors in the name of the algorithm refer to the points closest to the decision boundary, called the support, which have the greatest influence on the position of the hyperplane. SVM regressors work by fitting a non-parametric regression model to the data and trying to minimize the distance between the model and all training instances. SVM models are more complex than either a linear regressor or a random forest regressor and have almost no interpretability. The transformation of the features into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel removes all physical representation of the features. SVM models are black boxes but have high accuracy on small datasets with limited amounts of noise. The support vector machine also takes much longer to train than either of the other models. That being said, this approach demonstrated successful results in the literature and was therefore investigated [15] [16]. An example of a support vector machine for classification with several different kernels is shown in Figure 3. \\u00a7 Random Forest Regression: To understand the powerful random forest, one must first grasp the concept of a decision tree. The best way to describe a single decision tree is as a flowchart of questions, which leads to a classification/prediction. Each question (known as a node) has a yes/no answer based on the value of a particular explanatory variables. The two answers form branches leading away from the node. Eventually, the tree terminates in a node with a classification or prediction, which is called a leaf node. A single decision tree can be arbitrarily large and deep depending on the number of features and the number of classes. They are adept at both classification and regression and can learn a non-linear decision boundary. However, a single decision tree is prone to overfitting, especially as the depth of the tree increases because the decision tree is flexible leading to a tendency to memorize the training data (that is, it has a high variance). To solve this problem, ensembles of decision trees are combined into a powerful classifier known as a random forest [17]. Each tree in the forest is trained on a randomly chosen subset of the training data (either with replacement, called bootstrapping, or without) and on a subset of the features. This increases variability between trees making the overall forest more robust and less prone to overfitting. In order to make predictions, the random forest passes the explanatory variables (features) of an observation to all trees and takes an average of the votes of each tree (known as bagging). The random forest can also weight the votes of each tree with respect to the confidence the tree has in its prediction. Overall, the random forest is fast, relatively simple, has a moderate level of interpretability, and performs extremely well on both classification and regression tasks. There are a number of hyperparameters (best thought of as settings for the algorithm) that must be specified for the forest before training with the most important the number of trees in the forest, the number of features considered by each tree, the depth of the tree, and the minimum number of observations permitted at each leaf node of the tree. These can be selected by training many models with varying hyperparameters and selecting the combination that performs best on cross-validation or a testing set. A random forest performs implicit feature selection and can return relative feature importances which can be interpreted in the domain of the problem to determine the most useful variables for predicting the response. A model of a random forest that predicts energy consumption based on the time and weather conditions is presented in Figure 4. Additional techniques not covered in this report, but forming part of the EDIFES project include: \\u00d8 Diffusion Indices \\u00d8 Factorial Hidden Markov Chains \\u00d8 Wavelet Transformations \\u00d8 General Additive Models These techniques are discussed in papers regarding EFIDES, namely [7] and [8]. The majority of the development work for Project EDIFES is done in the R statistical programming language with some additional functionalities provided in Python. A number of packages are used for EDIFES, with most under active development. The main packages are rcradletools, used to retrieve building weather and energy data from HBase; 17-edifes, which contains a number of utilities and experimental functions built by the team; and BuildingRClean, which is used to clean a raw electricity dataset and currently contains all the building marker scripts. All the actual code is written by undergraduate and graduate students at CWRU which means there are issues when a team member graduates and another student must be brought in to the team. Having firsthand experienced the difficulties of wading through many lines of uncommented code, the author made an integral part of this project cleaning the existing code and enforcing standards so that new code can be understood and contributed to by multiple people. Weekly code reviews have now been put in place during which all members of the team examine an existing script. This process helps with standardization for such issues as variable and function naming and code control structures. Furthermore, to keep all members of the team up-to-date on action items and deadlines, the team has started using a Jira server to track and assign tasks. This is the third leg of the Jira-HipChat-BitBucket working foundation. Git is used for version control, with each team member working on a separate branch of each package. New functions must first be tested, then added to a development branch after review by multiple team members, and finally merged into the stable master branch after testing has confirmed the code works as intended and team members have had the opportunity to understand the function. These are all minor changes that collectively have had a substantial impact on the productivity and sustainability of the project. Members of the team are more willing to contribute to functions when they can understand the scripts, and knowing task responsibilities prevents repetition of work and ensures accountability. All data processing work is done through the High Powered Computing cluster at CWRU which is accessed through X2Go clients running on Raspberry Pi 3s in the center for Solar Degradation and Lifetime Extension (SDLE) laboratory. Intensive computations can be distributed and run in parallel on multiple cores with slurm jobs. For example, when running a building marker on all buildings, it is much more efficient to run each building on a different core rather than running them one building at a time sequentially in a loop. The High-Powered Computing resources and the use of HBase allows for rapid ingestion, reliable storage, and fast analysis of building data. Eventually, the entire ingestion, cleaning, analysis, and report generation process will be automated, allowing for virtual energy audits with a turn-around time of hours. Building markers are the foundation of the virtual energy audit. Long term, the EDIFES project will have a library of around forty functions which are able to determine information such as HVAC turn on and turn off times, base load to peak load ratio, synchronization of exterior lights with natural cycles, and type and size of HVAC systems. At the start of this semester, twenty markers were nearly complete but scattered across numerous scripts and R packages with poor documentation. In some cases, different versions of the functions were unknowingly run simultaneously by team members because of a lack of consistent naming standards. Over the course of this semester, all twenty building markers were cleaned, commented, renamed, and placed in the BuildingRClean package with proper documentation. This required going through each function line-by-line, and determining how and why it produced the given results. The original authors of the functions were involved when possible, and when not, the entire team was consulted to determine the purpose of the code. Eventually, all markers were documented, tested, and reviewed to an acceptable level where they could be added to the BuildingRClean package in the master branch. The markers continue to be developed on a daily basis, but this development work is done on separate branches with the working version always available in the master branch. After the building markers were stabilized, the next part of the project was to develop a markdown script that could run all of the functions on a single building. R markdown was chosen as the script type because it offers the ability to automatically output a PDF report with visuals, code, and commentary in one seamless document. Developing the script included writing code to retrieve building energy, weather, and meta data from HBase, calling each function in turn, and writing conditional statements to write different interpretations based on the results. The markdown script was completed over several months and has been used to generate over twenty reports. Creating a comprehensive PDF report involves changing only a single line of code (the building alphanumeric identifier) and renaming the file before selecting the option to \\u201cknit\\u201d the document. Overall, the entire process to generate a report once the building is in HBase is under 15 minutes, and the EDIFES team recently set a record by taking a raw building dataset to a complete report in under 24 hours, whereas at the beginning of the semester, this process took over a week. Eventually, the turn-around time should be shortened to just a few hours for commercial energy audits. A second aspect of the building marker work was to perform a cross-sectional study of the functions on 750+ buildings. Work in this area was repeatedly delayed by issues with data quality and the constant updating of the markers themselves, but nonetheless, preliminary results have been generated. These results can be grouped into several major areas: \\u00b7 Geographical distribution of buildings using both Koppen Geiger and ASHRAE climate zones \\u00b7 Quality of building datasets \\u00b7 Type of heating, either electrical or gas \\u00b7 Annual Consumption in kWh \\u00b7 Energy Use Intensity and Effective Thermal Resistance \\u00b7 Correlations between weather and energy use \\u00b7 Base load to peak load ratio \\u00b7 HVAC operating schedule One major area of interest for the project is comparing buildings across climate zones. Energy consumption patterns differ significantly depending on the geographical location of a building and comparing building within and between climate zones can reveal trends. Functions were written by the author to determine both the K\\u00f6ppen-Geiger and American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) climate zones of buildings [18] from the latitude and longitude. One limitation that was discovered was the skewed distribution of buildings in a small number of climate zones. This can be observed in Figure 5 and Figure 6 where the majority of buildings are located in Cfa (temperate, without a dry season, hot summer) and Dfa (cold, without a dry season, hot summer) K\\u00f6ppen Geiger climate zones. 75% of buildings were located in just two KG climate zones, although there were four zones with more than 30 buildings. The distribution across ASHRAE climate zones was similarly skewed, with over 80% of the buildings located in just two zones. Likewise, there were also four climate zones with at least thirty buildings. Before beginning any analysis, it is critical to ensure the data is of a high enough quality to allow statistically significant results to be derived. The EDIFES team has thus created a set of quality standards for objectively \\u201cgrading\\u201d a building. Eventually, EDIFES might charge customers a small fee for unacceptable data that requires a substantive amount of cleaning before it can be analyzed. In effect, the better the data, the more quality insights that can be gained from it. Figure 8 presents the quality standards for evaluating a building energy dataset. Figure 9 displays the data quality for all the buildings both before and after cleaning. The majority of buildings are at the highest level (AAAP) both before and after cleaning. A number of buildings improve through the cleaning procedure that involves removing anomalous points and imputing missing values. In order to quantify the changes that occur through cleaning, Figure 10 displays all of the changes that occurred. The most common improvement was from BAAP to AAAP reflecting the removal of outliers in the cleaning process. The heating type building marker is crucial to an energy analysis because EDIFES only has access to electricity data, and not natural gas use, and therefore, if a building has non-electrical heating, many of the functions do not apply year-round to the building. The heating type marker identifies whether a building has gas or electric heating. A map showing the results for all buildings is presented in Figure 11. Figure 11: Heating Type by Location Based on domain knowledge, it has been concluded by the EDIFES team that the heating type identification may not work as intended. The number of buildings with non-electrical heating in Southern California is highly suspect, although these could be coffee shops which typically have no heating. Currently, the building marker does not distinguish between no-heating and gas heating which could be a future improvement. The heating type for a building is determined by calculating the break point in temperature, or the temperature at which the building goes from heating to cooling. A piecewise linear model is then fitted to a graph of energy use versus temperature segmented by the temperature breakpoint. If the slope of the linear model in the heating section of the graph is positive, the conclusion is non-electrical heating, whereas if the slope is negative, this is believed to indicate electrical heating. The reasoning is that buildings with electrical heating will consume greater amounts of energy when the temperature is colder, whereas buildings with gas heating may use more gas with colder temperatures, but will not exhibit a noticeable increase in electricity consumption. It is possible this method is not applicable to all building types and may require an adjustment of the slope threshold for determining electrical versus non-electrical heating. The annual consumption of buildings (measured in kilowatt-hours) is mainly useful when comparing buildings with similar sizes in the same industry. As shown in Figure 12, the energy use of buildings can vary across several orders of magnitude. The annual consumption analysis showed the extreme range in energy use among buildings. Therefore, there is a need for a normalized metrics to be able to compare the energy use of buildings with different sizes. One simple measure is the energy use intensity (EUI) which is simply the annual energy consumption of a building divided by the square footage of the building (measured in kBTU/ft2yr). EUI values have been established for a number of industries by Energy Star that can be seen as the purple asterisks in Figure 13, which displays boxplots of the EUI for buildings by industry. Boxplots show the Interquartile range, median, and outliers for a distribution, which is helpful for assessing both the location of the median value as well as the spread of the values. As seen in the figure, most of the values are reasonable. As long as the square footage data is accurate (traditionally this has been an issue), the calculation of EUI is straightforward and mostly involves a conversion of units. Therefore, it would be expected the results from this marker are accurate for buildings with known areas. The benefit of this marker is that it can be used to make objective comparisons of the efficiency of buildings in a given industry while controlling for the size of the building. These results will prove useful when informing a building owner of the relative performance of her building. An additional marker with a significant potential for application is the effective thermal resistance (r- value). The R value for a building is a measure of the \\u201ctightness\\u201d of a building, or how well it is insulated. A building with better insulation and seals will have a higher R value which will lead to reduce heating and cooling costs. The results of running the marker on those buildings with square footages (the floor area and the number of floors is required to figure out the effective surface area of the building) are presented in Figure 14. The red vertical lines indicate the typical range as has been reported in the literature [19]. (Although these values were determined for residential buildings, they still provide a useful reference point.) The results are substantially above the typical range which indicates the building marker should be edited. One issue is calculating the effective surface area of a building which should be possible using the ground area and number of floors albeit with limited accuracy. This building marker is based solely on a thermodynamic rather than statistical analysis, and while the underlying principle has been proved from a mechanical engineering perspective, the implementation is not properly designed. A future project for the author will be correcting this building marker to reflect physically confirmed values. The energy use of a building depends to a significant extent of the weather conditions. The largest single uses of electricity for most office buildings is HVAC, which encompasses heating in the winter and cooling in the summer. The extent of HVAC usage thus is intricately related with the outdoor temperature, irradiance, and to a lesser extent, relative humidity and wind speed. A standard measure for assessing correlations is the Pearson correlation coefficient which ranges from -1, for a perfectly linear negative relationship, to +1 for a perfectly linear positive relationship [20]. Analysis of the weather correlations with energy use for different climate zones could be useful when developing a model that aims to predict the energy use from the time and weather. Moreover, knowing the greatest contributors to energy usage would allow the project to develop recommendations that aim to mitigate the effect of these weather conditions. Figure 15 and Figure 16 show the summer and winter correlations respectively for each climate zone. The dendrograms to the left and top of the plot are the results of hierarchical clustering which groups together similar climate zones and weather variables in terms of the correlations. There is a considerable amount of information to gather from these visuals. The most highly correlated variable with energy use during the summer is temperature followed by global horizontal irradiance (GHI). This indicates that as the temperature outdoors increases and the amount of sunlight hitting a building increases, the energy use increases correspondingly. During the summer, relative humidity is negatively correlated with energy use in all climate zones and the rest the weather variables have either a small relationship or no relationship with energy consumption during the summer. In the winter, there are no clear relationships, although it can be seen that some climate zones still have a positive correlation with energy use, while others display a negative relationship. A hypothesis to explain these contrasting relationships might be that the buildings with a positive correlation between temperature and energy use during the winter have gas heating while the buildings with a negative correlation have electrical heating and use more energy as the temperature decreases. Overall, the winter correlations are not as strong as those in the summer and do not display consistent trends across climate zones which is expected because buildings are designed differently based on the geographic location. The base load to peak load ratio measures the base average energy use of a building to the maximum sustained energy use. Typically, the base load is the amount of consumption when the building is unoccupied during the night or on the weekends, and the peak load occurs with the greatest level of HVAC usage. According to studies previously conducted by the EDIFES team, a base to peak ratio of greater than 0.3 indicates opportunities for electricity savings by reducing the base load of the building. The base load needs of buildings can vary significantly across industries however (a data center will basically have a base to peak ratio of 1.0, while a retail store could be much lower) and the threshold for reduction of the base load will need to be industry specific. Figure 17 shows the base to peak load ratio for summer and winter divided out by the sample set. Each sample set is composed of different customers although all the buildings in one sample set are not necessarily within the same industry. The blue vertical line indicates the threshold above which electricity use can be reduced by minimizing the base load. Over 90% of buildings have energy saving opportunities during the winter, and 84% can save energy during the summer. The threshold might need to be adjusted based on additional cross-sectional work and literature surveys. Another insightful graph for this marker is the change in base to peak ratio from one year to the next. If the ratio declines, that indicates the building is becoming more efficient, while an increase could represent the building becoming less efficient. These relationships also might be influenced by the weather conditions which should be an area of further research. Changes in the base to peak ratio from the first year of data to the last are shown in Figure 18. A positive change indicates an improvement. Overall, 45.5% of buildings with more than one year of data improved in terms of base to peak ratio, 43.7% declined, and the rest displayed no change. Again, these changes could be the result of changing weather conditions or they could indicate a concerted effort from a company to improve building efficiency. A highly active area of focus for improving building energy efficiency is smart scheduling of the HVAC system. The system should turn on as late as possible in the morning while still reaching the desired set point in time, and should turn off as early as possible in the evening while maintaining comfortable conditions during operating hours. The turn on and turn off times are calculated by finding large changes in energy (positive for turn on and negative for turn off) and recording the most frequent times for these changes. As HVAC systems typically use the most energy of any system in a building, the largest changes in energy consumption should correspond to changes in HVAC operating conditions. Figure 19 and Figure 20 show the HVAC turn on and turn off times respectively for the sample set. A density plot is not the same as a proportion plot, but instead is a probability density function for the times on the x-axis. The density on the y-axis can be interpreted as the probability of a turn on or turn off at the specified time. Different businesses have different operating hours, as is indicated by the plots. These graphics lead to a level of confidence in the building markers because the results are reasonable and have in some cases been verified with real-world results. For example, by looking at the opening and closing times of Starbucks, it was determined that the function produced results aligned with operating hours. By comparing the HVAC schedule with building occupancy schedules, it is possible for a building owner to devise a more efficient climate-control scheme. An even better solution might be the adoption of smart thermostats that automatically learn the schedule of a building and adjust based on both employee occupancy and the projected weather. The first step in working in a new field is to gain an intuitive understanding of the structure and relationships within the available data. This allows a researcher to learn the expected patterns and to spot anomalies or unexpected trends for further study. Therefore, the initial phase of this work began with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a cleaned dataset of eight Progressive office buildings distributed in six different K\\u00f6ppen Geiger climate zones. The EDA quickly revealed that buildings exhibit daily, seasonal, and yearly energy consumption patterns that vary significantly across climate zones. Figure 21 shows the variability in energy consumption for a building location in Nevada. The message from this figure is that any model that attempts to predict or forecast energy consumption for a building must be flexible enough to capture all of the inherent trends within the data. Clearly, there is not a simple linear relationship between the weather consumption and the time of day or the season of the year. A major focus of the EDA was on the relationships between weather conditions and energy consumption. Figure 22 illustrates (A.) the summer correlations between weather and energy use and (B.) the winter correlations in terms of the Pearson correlation coefficient for the eight office buildings. Mirroring the cross-sectional analysis, temperature was found to have the greatest positive correlation between energy consumption and energy use (excluding the anomalous PGE1 building), a fact that was confirmed in later modeling with non-linear methods. A linear relationship offers interpretability, and one conclusion was that an increase of 1\\u02daC in temperature could increase the energy use of a large office building by 300 kWh over the course of a single day. This would result in over $40 in increased electricity costs at the national average electricity price of $0.1319 / kWh [21]. There were limitations in the EDA due to the sample size of eight buildings, and therefore an alternative source of data from the City of Chicago [22] was required to determine the relationship between the size of a building and total annual energy consumption. A BoxCox transformation [23] was applied to find the best power transformation for the relationship, and it was concluded that yearly energy consumption is positively linearly correlated with building squared footage on a log-log scale. Using data from 7500 buildings in Chicago, Illinois, the R-Squared value between the log of annual energy consumption and the log of square footage was 0.8476. This is classified as a strong linear relationship. The R-Squared value represents the fraction of variability in the response (energy consumption) explained by the explanatory variables in a model (in this example only square feet). Therefore, from this analysis, 84.76% of the variability in annual energy consumption among buildings in Chicago is due to the variability in square footages of the buildings. Additional findings from the exploratory data analysis are covered in the Prediction and Forecasting Energy Use with Machine Learning Algorithms section of the report. While certainly not the main public focus of data science projects, proper documentation and coding standards is usually the deciding factor in whether a project succeeds or stumbles. In a project comprised primarily of students, documentation takes on an even greater level of importance. Several issues were identified at the beginning of the semester: messy code with no comments indicating functionality, multiple versions of scripts residing across many local directories and branches, and no method for tracking issues and assigned tasks. All three issues were successfully addressed during the semester, with plans put in place to ensure the issues will be managed on an ongoing basis. The objective of the documentation reform was not a one-time push to fix all uncommented scripts, but rather a shift in thought processes so new functions are developed with sustainability in mind. To that end, numerous ongoing practices have been instituted for the EDIFES team. The most beneficial of these has been the weekly code review that focuses on going line-by-line through one or two existing scripts. At least ten scripts have been completely commented and corrected and the process has been beneficial for all members of the team. There are countless ways to solve programming and statistical problems, and one of the most crucial parts of the code review is listening to others explain their methodology so one can view the problem from a different light. As students, all members of the team are open-minded, which means everyone is willing to abandon an old manner of working if they see there are significant benefits to a different approach. In effect, individuals are able to take advantage of the collective knowledge of the team without having to make all the same mistakes themselves. In addition to changing mindsets towards writing reproducible code and analyses, the code reviews have eliminated many mistakes in existing functions, and in one notable case, increased the runtime of the daylight lighting sensors building marker by a factor of twenty. Additional concrete steps taken to streamline the project were the establishment of a set of coding and package development standards, and the set-up of a Jira server to track tasks. The coding standards try to create consistency without requiring uniformity and address matters from variable names to the ideal length of lines. The package development standards require functions to be developed on personal side branches, tested before being moved to a development branch, and reviewed by multiple team members before being merged into the stable branch. The Jira server integrates with the existing communication (HipChat) and version control (Git) tools used on the project. Team members are able to assign tasks through Jira and are notified of pull requests and commits through the HipChat instant messaging service. While there are still some issues with getting all team members to adopt the workflow, it is already showing promising signs of helping individuals to concentrate on the most important tasks. New practices for committing work have helped to reduce the number of non-working scripts in stable branches of the packages and ensure that the entire team has access to the most current version of all functions. Prediction of future energy use (known as forecasting) is critical for the EDIFES project because it will allow comparisons between the building continuing to operate as normal and the building operating with improvements designed to improve efficiency. In addition to developing a model that can accurately forecast consumption given continued operating conditions, EDIFES also must develop a method that allows one to alter different characteristics of a building in order to assess the effects on energy consumption [7]. The final report to a building owner must include a set of recommendations for reducing energy use, and these suggestions should be quantified in terms of dollars and kilowatt-hours. In order to test the accuracy of a forecasting method, the prediction ability can be assessed by predicting six months of energy consumption. In essence, the training data is all historical data except for the final six months, and the final six months of data is used for testing. ARPE-E has established a project requirement of creating a model that can predict six months of energy consumption with an r-squared value of at least 0.85. Work documented in this report is of an exploratory nature and was intended to serve as a measure of the feasibility of different approaches to the problem. Current and past approaches by EDIFES team members have involved techniques such as diffusion indices and wavelet transformation methods [8]. In this report, three machine-learning methods were experimentally tested: linear regression, support vector machine regression, and random forest regression. The problem was approached as a supervised regression problem. There are a number of explanatory variables (weather and time features) that are used to predict the response variable (energy consumption). This is a regression problem because the output is continuous and it is supervised because the targets (energy consumption) are known ahead of time and given to the model during training. The algorithms learn the relationship between the exploratory and response variables, and during testing, the algorithm is evaluated on data for which is has never seen the targets. The three algorithms selected were designed to cover the range of complexity and interpretability in models, starting with the simplest, Linear Regression, proceeding to the ensemble Random Forest method, and finally moving on to the Support Vector Machine Regressor. The Linear Regression has no hyperparameters to tune, the Random Forest was built with the defaults except the number of decision trees was set to two hundred, and the Support Vector Machine used all default hyperparameters and the radial basis kernel. To compare the algorithms, a random train-test split was used (with the same features and labels used for all models). The objective was to select the best performer on the random split and implement this method for predicting six months of energy consumption. All three algorithms were built using the Scikit-Learn library in Python [24] while the data was preprocessed in R. Transferring the data between R and Python is relatively simple with the feather library that saves and loads dataframes in R and pandas dataframes in Python. The basic steps for evaluating the algorithms on a random training/testing split are as follows: 1. Structure the data into an appropriate format, and separate the features and labels. 2. Subset the data into a training and testing set using a 0.75/0.25 split 3. Train each model on the same training set with the model fed both the features and the labels. 4. Use the trained model to predict the testing labels from the testing features. 5. Compute performance metrics with the known testing labels and predicted values. 6. Make comparisons between algorithms for interpretability and accuracy. Data preparation involved the following four steps: \\u00d8 One-hot encoding of categorical variables \\u00d8 Transformation of cyclical variables into a sinusoidal representation \\u00d8 Normalize variables to have zero mean and unit variance \\u00d8 Separate into random training and testing features and labels Results achieved on a random training/testing split for six Progressive office buildings appear in Figure 24 and Figure 25. The mean average percentage error (MAPE) is the mean of the residuals divided by the true values and is a relative error. The R-Squared value is a measure of the fraction of variability explained by the explanatory variables in the model divided by the total variable in the response variables. The Random Forest significantly outperformed the Linear Regression and Support Vector Machine Regressor on the random training/testing split. Moreover, the Random Forest was relatively quick to train compared to the SVM and maintains a level of interpretability. Thus, the Random Forest was selected by optimization and assessment of forecasting ability. Optimization of machine learning algorithms either involves altering the features fed into the model or tuning the hyperparameters of the model. As interpretability is a key factor for this project, the features were left as is (with the few minor transformations covered above) but the random forest was adjusted to fit the task. The hyperparameters of a model are best thought of as settings that can be tuned to achieve better performance for a given problem. In contrast to model parameters, which are learned during training, the model hyperparameters must be explicitly set by the developer before training. There are a number of methods for efficiently evaluating a range of hyperparameters for a problem, and the approach used in this report was grid search cross-validation implemented in Scikit-Learn. The final parameters for the random forest were chosen by using grid search with a specified grid and are as follows: \\u00d8 200 decision tres in the forest \\u00d8 No maximum depth for each tree \\u00d8 A minimum of 1 sample per leaf node \\u00d8 A maximum of 50% of the features evaluated by each tree \\u00d8 A minimum of 2 samples to split a node \\u00d8 A minimum impurity decrease of 0.0 to split a node The optimized Random Forest achieved better performance metrics compared to the baseline model using the same training/testing split for the eight office buildings as shown in . The optimized Random Forest was then used to predict six months of energy use after learning from historical data. Example predictions of the optimized Random Forest on a six month test set can be seen in Figure 26 and Figure 27. The R-Squared for these predictions was over 0.9, meeting the project requirements. The figures demonstrate that the Random Forest regression model was able to accurately predict six months of electricity consumption. Accuracy was not as high on all datasets, and further work is currently ongoing in order to optimize the model for building energy prediction. A benefit of the Random Forest is its ability to return feature importances. These relative weightings can be used for feature selection and to provide a physical explanation for the predictions of the forest. The feature importances for the Random Forest averaged across the eight Progressive office buildings are presented in Figure 28. In agreement with the correlation values calculated in the cross-sectional study and the EDA, the temperature is the greatest explained of energy consumption. Whether or not the day was a weekday or weekend was the second most important variable which is not unexpected considering these buildings are office building that displays considerably different energy consumption on the weekends than during the week. These features importances can be used to perform feature selection for future algorithms or to determine which weather conditions should be targeted for reducing building energy consumption. Furthermore, it is possible to alter a single variable and then observe the effects on the response. In this case, the effect of increasing the temperature on energy consumption can be investigated to see how changes in the climate will change building energy use. Current predictions indicate the global surface temperature will increase between 1\\u02daC and 4\\u02da C by 2100 as the result of human-caused climate change [25] [26]. In order to assess these effects on future energy use consumption, a reasonable increase of 2\\u02daC can be modeled using the random forest. This is done by training the model on the entire historical data available, and then creating a testing set by keeping all of the explanatory variables the same except for the temperature, which will be increased in every interval by 2\\u02da C reflecting a mean increase in line with current forecast for future warming. In this situation, there are no correct values to compare the predictions to, and this is purely an experiment to observe the effects. The economic effects in terms of annual energy use costs are demonstrated in Figure 29. These results were obtained by finding the difference between the unaltered energy consumption and the prediction energy consumption with the temperature increase and then multiplying by the average cost of electricity in the United States. One aspect of global warming that often goes unmentioned is it will unevenly effect different areas of the globe, with some locations enjoying longer growing seasons and others experiencing frequent severe weather events. The unequal distribution of the effects of climate change are reflected in the figure which demonstrates that according to the random forest model, some areas will see a reduction in energy usage (and hence cost) while other areas will see a significant increase in energy use. According to this analysis, an office building of 50,000 ft2 could see an increase of nearly $30,000 in annual energy costs due to increased temperatures. Many arguments have been made for taking steps to reduce carbon emissions and transition to sustainable energy sources, but perhaps none is more persuasive than that of simple economics. Overall, the modeling demonstrated the feasibility of using a trained machine learning model for predicting building energy consumption. In contrast to other techniques, the Random Forest predictions can be interpreted and explained in terms of physical quantities, and this method has experimental uses beyond predicting energy use. A number of objectives drove work on this semester project. Primarily, the focus was on refinement on building markers and a cross-sectional study of the building markers. Secondary work included an exploratory data analysis of eight office buildings, correcting inadequate documentation, and building an energy prediction model. Work done in this report is a small fraction of the overall effort involved in Project EDIFES but touched on a number of areas that will be key to the team moving forward. Deliverables are as follows: \\u00d8 Building marker scripts were corrected, commented, documentation, and assembled into one package for ease of access and proper version control \\u00d8 A markdown script was developed to run all existing markers on a building and create a PDF report \\u00d8 Preliminary work on the cross-sectional study of building markers has validated some markers and shown significant work remains to improve others to better reflect real-world conditions. \\u00d8 An EDA of eight office buildings identified major trends and patterns in energy consumption. \\u00d8 Code reviews have been instituted on a weekly basis and a set of documentation/coding standards has been adopted by the team. In addition, a system for tracking tasks and commits is now in use \\u00d8 A Random Forest Regression model achieved high accuracy in prediction. A general additive model that is able to capture all of the various trends in the building energy data might prove to be more capable as a forecasting method. A fundamental limitation of any data science project is the quality and quantity of the data. Both of these proved to be obstacles over the course of this semester. Although there are over 750 buildings in HBase with cleaned energy data, the quality of the data varies significantly. Moreover, the buildings have energy data at, different intervals which can play havoc with some of the functions that were originally hard-coded for data every 15 minutes. This makes running the building markers on all of the buildings a challenge in ensuring the markers are building-agnostic. During the Progressive office building EDA, the quality of the data was not an issue but, instead, it was the quantity that was an obstacle. A general rule of thumb in statistics is that 30 samples are required to make statistically significant findings due to the central limit theorem that states non-skewed distributions of variables with more than 30 samples tend to approach normal. Thus, while each building may have had hundreds of thousands of individual datapoints, it was not possible to make meaningful comparisons between buildings. Additional obstacles arose because of the dynamic nature of the project. Functions are constantly updated, which means that in order to keep the script that runs all building markers working requires constant adjustments. Each time a function is changed so that it accepts different inputs or produces different output, the script must be updated to reflect these changes. Furthermore, the interpretations of the results of the markers are constantly in flux as team members adjust models and acquire new domain knowledge. This is not an unexpected or unwelcome issue because it allows errors to be caught and it is better that the functions produce meaningful output rather than that they work but the results have no physical interpretation. There are too many assumptions made across the project to list them all here, but one example is the definition of seasons. This may seem to be a straightforward problem, but the definition of seasons can change significantly depending on the field one works in. The team has decided to use the meteorological definition of seasons, with summer defined as June, July, and August, and winter as December, January, February. These definitions provide a starting point, but it is clear the season definitions should be fluid and change across climate zones. Some locations may essentially have only two six-month long seasons, while others have four distinct seasons with different energy use patterns in each. There are many other examples where assumptions have been made based on intuitions or limited domain knowledge. If every single decision was debated until it had been verified with no doubt, the project would not be able to move forward. Therefore, assumptions are required and are acceptable as long as they are pointed out and addressed when enough evidence allows for a robust conclusion. This report encompasses four major areas of work. The first, and most important, was the organization and fine-tuning of the building markers along with a cross-sectional study applied to hundreds of buildings. The final deliverable from this procedure was a single R markdown script (see the Code Sample in the Appendices) that can run all existing markers on a building and a presentation of the study results. The markdown document allows the team to generate comprehensive reports with a limited amount of human effort. These reports can then be shown to commercial partners who are able to validate the findings. For instance, the team has learned that the heating and cooling oversized building markers provide almost no information at this point because all Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems are designed to be oversized so they are not overwhelmed on days with extreme weather conditions. Other markers, such as Energy Use Intensity, and HVAC schedule, have been shown to be reliable reflections of real-world conditions. This is important because it can be easy to get lost in the complicated statistical analysis and forget that in the end, the systems being modeled and predicted have physical counterparts, and the statistical methods must produce results consistent with reality. A careful review of the twenty building markers has improved them both in terms of accuracy and efficiency. The literature for this area mainly does not exist because EDIFES is taking a new approach to the energy audit procedure. Typical industry rules of thumb do not necessarily apply when one is doing an audit without ever setting foot in the building, but many of the markers are informed at least in part by domain knowledge. Overall, the impact of the work on the building markers has been considerable because of the reduced time to generate a report and the capability of running a single marker on hundreds of buildings. Having all of the markers in a single package with proper development rules ensures all team members are using the most recent version of the marker which improves consistency and eliminates confusion from unexpected contrasting results. Furthermore, the cross-sectional study of all building markers has revealed that while some markers are accurate, others will need to be improved, including effective thermal resistance and heating type. Previously, the markers had been run on small, homogeneous samples of buildings, and running them against hundreds of buildings proved there are biases that can arise from developing markers with similar buildings. Buildings vary considerably across industries and geographical regions and functions should be robust to these changes and applicable to all buildings. Addressing these issues could be as simple as adding if statements to the code to handle different buildings appropriately. An additional conclusion from the analysis was there is a need for high-quality data including accurate building areas as the value of the virtual audit will be directly proportional to the quality of the data. Several functions (including EUI, effective thermal resistance, and perhaps building energy disaggregation) require an accurate square footage in order to obtain meaningful results. The cross-sectional study has been exploratory in nature, and the next steps in this project will involve interpreting the results and implementing findings. The office building EDA provided the ideal opportunity to explore the problem domain. Many of the findings, while not entirely novel [7] [8], were surprising to the author. All of these could have been directly told to the author, but it is a more memorable exercise to have to write the code and then make the discoveries firsthand rather than hearing them passively. Moreover, it is reassuring when the conclusions reached by an independent team member agree with those established by the rest of the team. While disagreements drive progress, similar results confirm the methods in use and allow for the establishment of base truths from which to work. The major finding was the number of different patterns that can be ascertained in the energy data. Each building exhibits different trends depending on the day of the week, the season of the year, and even between years if a retrofit to improve efficiency has been performed. Moreover, once the office buildings had been thoroughly explored, a set of coffee shops was examined and found to have entirely different patterns! Clearly, the process of modeling and eventually forecasting energy consumption will require sophisticated methods that can separate each of the trends [27] [28]. Additional significant findings from the EDA were weather and energy correlations that show temperature and global horizontal irradiance (GHI) are the most highly correlated variables with energy use during the summer. These results suggest several methods for reducing energy consumption including increasing insulation, installing shades over windows in direct sunlight, properly sealing windows and doors, and positioning buildings to use the sun as a natural source of heating in the winter without absorbing excess heat in the summer [29]. The EDA also showed the interpretations that can be drawn from a linear model as well as the limitations linear models have because they are not flexible enough to capture intricate trends. One significant aspect of the EDA that was unsuccessful was the attempt to normalize buildings across climate zones, building types, and building sizes. There were not enough buildings to make these comparisons, but they might be possible to make with the entire set of buildings available in HBase. Overall, the exploratory data analysis was an optimal way to get a start with the EDIFES project and opened up many exciting additional questions for research. The main motivation for the improved documentation push was the author\\u2019s experience trying to contribute to the project. It was exceedingly difficult to fix broken building markers due to the nearly complete lack of documentation. More than that, there was no standard style across the code with variable and function names appearing as camelCase in some scripts and separated with under_scores in others. All of this made parsing these files extremely difficult, even when taking a dataframe and passing it through the function one line at a time. Trying to fix these scripts was akin to climbing a mountain in a snowstorm with no signs to guide one\\u2019s way. These concerns had been present in other team members but were pushed to the side to focus on developing more statistical methods and implementing them in additional functions. It took repeated suggestions to encourage all the project members to make a concerted effort to improve documentation. The first major success was the establishment of weekly code review sessions where all members of the team sit down together and review one or two scripts line-by-line, adding comments and fixing mistakes along the way. Already these sessions have produced notable victories, including improving the efficiency of one marker by twenty times through the elimination of a redundant loop. The code reviews also highlight the benefits of a cross-disciplinary team. Team members have backgrounds in computer science, statistics, electrical engineering, and mechanical engineering and bring different knowledge and skill sets to each meeting. One example of how this benefits the team occurred during a review of a function in which one team member had tried to remove outliers by taking away the top and bottom 2% of datapoints. He did not necessarily have any rationale for this decision other than that it produced results that seemed to agree with intuition. However, there is a statistical definition for outliers that is more robust than \\u201c2% of datapoints at the top and bottom\\u201d and the statistician was able to provide the correct definition (more than 1.5 times the IQR above the third quartile, or more than 1.5 times the IQR below the first quartile). There was a robust debate about the value of statistical definitions versus intuitive judgments, and through this discussion, everyone looked at the problem from multiple angles. Moments like this have become commonplace in code review and all team members agree it has been positive not only for what gets accomplished during the meeting but for how individuals then approach writing code by themselves outside of meetings. The overall result is a better-documented code base that any team member can feel comfortable contributing to as required. Additional parts of the documentation reformation include implementation of task tracking software and establishment of a set of coding and development standards. These actions have reduced conflicts between function versions and reduce the friction involved in working on code collaboratively. Together with a strong version control system, these measures allow the project to be robust to individual mistakes which consequently encourages team members to be more experimental in developing additional functions. The building owner (or the Department of Energy reviewers) will never see the documentation itself, but they will see the results that the documentation has made possible to attain. The entire EDIFES project is a push to increase the sustainability of society, and the documentation effort is aimed to increase the sustainability of the project. Similar to most other parts of this project, the modeling and forecasting section was experimental. The end goal is to develop a model that is able to forecast future energy consumption, both under normal operating conditions, and accounting for a retrofit. However, these early efforts were mostly concerned with evaluating a number of different approaches for feasibility as opposed to finishing a fully completed model. From the results of the EDA, it was certain a linear model would not be an accurate model because of the non-linearity of relationships between time and weather versus energy consumption. This conclusion was borne out by the modeling investigations that found Linear Regression to be extremely inept at predicting energy consumption from weather and time variables. Moreover, a review of the literature showed that non-linear methods including support vector machines and artificial neural networks had been the most successful tools for predicting energy consumption in buildings [27] [28]. Overall, investigations performed during this report showed the Random Forest Regression model achieved unmatched prediction accuracy when evaluated on a random training/testing split of the data. When the model was then applied to predicting six months of energy consumption, it was able to achieve above 0.85 r-squared on 4 of the 8 buildings in the Progressive dataset and is currently being run on all buildings in HBase. Besides prediction, a random forest can be used for other experimental procedures. One possible implementation of the Random Forest would be to replay past data but change one or multiple variables and observe the response. For example, it is possible to simulate an increase in temperature by training a model on all available data for a year, then adding 1 degree to all the temperature data points and predicting the resulting energy consumption. Altering the weather variables would be interesting, but the real application would be changing characteristics of the building such as the amount of insulation or HVAC operating schedule and observing the resulting effect on electricity use. One motivation for research into these particular methods was the author\\u2019s interest in machine learning, and if nothing else, this investigation revealed there are limits to this exciting field and success takes considerable effort. There is a need for more research in the modeling and forecasting part of the project, and many new techniques, such as general additive modeling should be attempted. Modeling requires experience to select the correct algorithm, feature transformations, and model settings, and this project provided many opportunities for exploring and studying the machine learning field. The overall objective of Project EDIFES is to develop a platform for virtual energy audits using data science tools and automated processing /analysis workflows. The work documented in this report touched on many different areas of the project and addressed needs of the team as they arose. The main project objectives of refining the building markers, creating a markdown script to generate a pdf document with no manual input, and performing a cross-sectional exploratory analysis were all accomplished. The building markers are now located in one package for ease of access to the current working version, and the completed markdown script can create a pdf report in minutes. The cross-sectional analysis has determine which markers produce reasonable results and which need more focus. The office building exploratory data analysis revealed the numerous trends in energy data at different timescales and the significant correlations between energy use and weather conditions. Moreover, this EDA provided an introduction to the project domain and the tools commonly used by the team. Experimental work with three machine learning algorithms for predicting energy consumption showed the Random Forest Regression model to be capable of achieving r-squared values greater than 0.9 when prediction six months of energy use. Additional methods should be considered for prediction, as this is a problem that will require multiple approaches. Finally, a major push for improved documentation and understandable code led to the establishment of weekly code reviews, a platform for assigning and monitoring tasks, and a set of development and coding standards. Already, the effects of these changes have been felt across the project and it is on more sustainable footing as a result. The many different areas of focus for this report are an indication of the cross-disciplinary nature of Project EDIFES, which makes the work always engaging. Although there are also numerous challenges that come from such a broad project, the author has enjoyed every minute of work thus far and is eager to see the effects the project will have on improving building energy efficiency. There are three main parts of EDIFES that will need to be addressed in the coming semester: building energy use disaggregation, predicting/forecasting energy use, and developing additional building markers. Disaggregation in the building energy domain has traditionally been approached from a pure statistics point of view using techniques such as Factorial Hidden Markov Models [8]. However, thermodynamic approaches have also been successful, although with residential buildings rather rather than commercial [30]. Previous attempts by EDIFES required prior knowledge of the HVAC systems and sizes, which cannot be accurately determined as of now from the overall building energy consumption. There is thus a need for a method that does not rely on knowledge of the individual system sizes in order to separate out the component energy usages from the whole. This is an active area of research and current attempts have shown the thermodynamic model is feasible although it will require some adjustments for use on commercial buildings. The method will likely require the effective thermal resistance, which the current building marker does not accurately compute when compared to the relevant literature. A further area of work is forecasting future energy use, both under operating conditions as normal and with a building energy retrofit. In addition to the author\\u2019s work with machine learning methods, current work focuses on a wavelength transformation method that takes a signal and decomposes it into a number of levels each at a different frequency. These levels could represent different physical characteristics of the building, and after performing a transformation, the next step is to separate out the individual components. Then, these components can be altered to reflect a building retrofit and added back in to the overall signal in order to determine the total effect on energy consumption. General additive models (GAM) have proven adept at forecasting time-series in a number of domains [31]. A GAM separates a time-series signal into a number of time patterns, such as weekly, seasonally, or yearly although with the overall trend (such as increasing with time). The model can then be used to forecast the time series into the future. A picture of a general additive model of building energy data created using the prophet package available in both Python and R [32] is presented in Figure 30. Finally, additional building markers need to be developed to build a more robust energy profile of a building. Ideas currently under development include anomalous activity detection, clustering buildings into different energy use groups, and assessing the uncertainty in data analyses performed given the data characteristics. Overall, it is clear that much works remains to be done in many aspects of the EDIFES project. All of the areas of the project involve exploration and experimentation, and it has been a joy to work with this team on a task with substantial, tangible real-world benefits for sustainability! The author would like to thank the following members of the EDIFES team for their willingness to patiently explain all aspects of the project and for their tolerance of a considerable number of questions: Professor Alexis Abramson, Professor Roger French, Rojiar Haddadian, Arash Khalilnejad, Jack Mousseau, Shreyas Kamath, and Ahmad Karimi. 1.

There comes a time when it\\u2019s necessary to move on from even the most beloved tools. Matplotlib has served its purpose of quickly creating simple charts, but I\\u2019ve grown frustrated with how much code is required to customize plots or do seemingly easy things like get the x-axis to correctly show dates. For a while, I\\u2019ve been looking for an alternative \\u2014 not a complete replacement as Matplotlib is still useful for exploration \\u2014 ideally, a library that has interactive elements and lets me focus on what I want to show instead of getting caught in the how to show it details. Enter plotly, a declarative visualization tool with an easy-to-use Python library for interactive graphs. In this article, we\\u2019ll get an introduction to the plotly library by walking through making basic time series visualizations. These graphs, though easy to make, will be fully interactive figures ready for presentation. Along the way, we\\u2019ll learn the basic ideas of the library which will later allow us to rapidly build stunning visualizations. If you have been looking for an alternative to matplotlib, then as we\\u2019ll see, plotly is an effective choice. The full code for this article is available on GitHub. You can also view the notebook with interactive elements on nbviewer. The data used in this article is anonymized building energy time-series data from my job at Cortex Building Intelligence. If you want to use your web dev skills to help buildings save energy, then get in touch because we\\u2019re hiring! Plotly is a company that makes visualization tools including a Python API library. (Plotly also makes Dash, a framework for building interactive web-based applications with Python code). For this article, we\\u2019ll stick to working with the plotly Python library in a Jupyter Notebook and touching up images in the online plotly editor. When we make a plotly graph, it\\u2019s published online by default which makes sharing visualizations easy. You will need to create a free plotly account which gives you 25 public charts and 1 private chart. Once you hit your quota, you\\u2019ll have to delete some of the old charts to make new ones (or you can run in an offline mode where images only appear in the notebook). Install plotly ( pip install plotly ) and run the following to authenticate the library, replacing the username and API key: The standard plotly imports along with the settings to run offline are: When we make plots in offline mode, we\\u2019ll get a link in the bottom right of the image to export to the plotly online editor to make touch-ups and share. Plotly (the Python library) uses declarative programming which means we write code describing what we want to make rather than how to make it. We provide the basic framework and end goals and let plotly figure out the implementation details. In practice, this means less effort spent building up a figure, allowing us to focus on what to present and how to interpret it. If you don\\u2019t believe in the benefits of this method, then go check out the dozens of examples such as the one below made with 50 lines of code. For this project, we\\u2019ll be using real-world building data from my job at Cortex Building Intelligence (data has been anonymized). Building energy data presents intriguing challenges for time-series analysis because of seasonal, daily, and weekly patterns and drastic effects from weather conditions. Effectively visualizing this data can help us understand the response of a building and where there are chances for energy savings. (As a note, I use the terms \\u201cPower\\u201d and \\u201cEnergy\\u201d interchangeably even though energy is the ability to do work while power is the rate of energy consumption. Technically, power is measured in kilowatts (KW) and electrical energy is measured in KiloWatt Hours (KWh). The more you know!) Our data is in a dataframe with a multi-index on the columns to keep track of the sensor type and the sensor number. The index is a datetime: Working with multi-index dataframes is an entirely different article (here are the docs), but we won\\u2019t do anything too complicated. To access a single column and plot it, we can do the following. The default plot (provided by matplotlib) looks like: This isn\\u2019t terrible, especially for one line of code. However, there is no interactivity, and it\\u2019s not visually appealing. Time to get into plotly. Much like Bokeh (articles), making a basic plot requires a little more work in plotly, but in return, we get much more, like built-in interactivity. We build up a graph starting with a data object. Even though we want a line chart, we use go.Scatter() . Plotly is smart enough to automatically give us a line graph if we pass in more than 20 points! For the most basic graph, all we need is the x and y values: Then, we create a layout using the default settings along with some titles: (We use dict(x = 'value') syntax which is the same as {'x': 'value'} ). Finally, we can create our figure and display it interactively in the notebook: Right away, we have a fully interactive graph. We can explore patterns, inspect individual points, and download the plot as an image. Notice that we didn\\u2019t even need to specify the axis types or ranges, plotly got that completely right for us. We even get nicely formatted hover messages with no extra work. What\\u2019s more, this plot is automatically exported to plotly which means we can share the chart with anyone. We can also click Edit Chart and open it up in the online editor to make any changes we want in an easy-to-use interface: If you edit the chart in the online editor you can then automatically generate the Python code for the exact graph and style you have created! Even a basic time-series plot in Plotly is impressive but we can improve it with a few more lines of code. For example, let\\u2019s say we want to compare the steam usage of the building with the energy. These two quantities have vastly different units, so if we show them on the same scale it won\\u2019t work out. This is a case where we have to use a secondary y-axis. In matplotlib, this requires a large amount of formatting work, but we can do it quite easily in Plotly. The first step is to add another data source, but this time specify yaxis='y2'. (We also add in a few other parameters to improve the styling which can be seen in the notebook). Then, when we create the layout, we need to add a second y-axis. When we display the graph, we get both steam and energy on the same graph with properly scaled axes. With a little online editing, we get a finished product: Plot annotations are used to call out aspects of a visualization for attention. As one example, we can highlight the daily high consumption of steam while looking at a week\\u2019s worth of data. First, we\\u2019ll subset the steam sensor into one week (called steam_series_four) and create a formatted data object: Then, we\\u2019ll find the daily max values for this sensor (see notebook for code): To build the annotations, we\\u2019ll use a list comprehension adding an annotation for each of the daily maximum values ( four_highs is the above series). Each annotation needs a position ( x , y) and text: (The <br> in the text is html which is read by plotly for displaying). There are other parameters of an annotation that we can modify, but we\\u2019ll let plotly take care of the details. Adding the annotations to the plot is as simple as passing them to the layout : After a little post-processing in the online editor, our final plot is: The extra annotations can give us insights into our data by showing when the daily peak in steam usage occurs. In turn, this will allow us to make steam start time recommendations to building engineers. We have only scratched the surface of what we can do in plotly. I\\u2019ll explore some of these functions in a future article, and refer to the notebook for how to add even more interactivity such as selection menus. Eventually, we can build deployable web applications in Dash with Python code. For now, we know how to create basic \\u2014 yet effective \\u2014 time-series visualizations in plotly. Although I\\u2019m not abandoning matplotlib \\u2014 one-line bar and line charts are hard to beat \\u2014 it\\u2019s clear that using matplotlib for custom charts is not a good time investment. Instead, we can use other libraries, including plotly, to efficiently build full-featured interactive visualizations. Seeing your data in a graph is one of the joys of data science, but writing the code is often painful. Fortunately, with plotly, visualizations in Python are intuitive, even enjoyable to create and achieve the goal of graphs: visually understand our data. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. When Time Warner\\u2019s CEO heard Game of Thrones was the most pirated TV show in the world, he said this was \\u201cbetter than an Emmy\\u201d. The show\\u2019s director similar comments, saying that the illicit downloads created a \\u201cbuzz\\u201d around the show. Instead of pursuing the perpetrators to the full extent of the law, HBO took a soft stance and let the downloads continue. While this may seem counterintuitive, the thinking went the more people who found the show through any means, the more talk about it there would be, leading to a greater number of paying customers. Rather than spending fortunes trying to stop the inevitable, HBO accepted the piracy as a positive. While there are certainly other factors at play, this decision seems to be wise in light of the record viewership Game of Thrones would attain. When I found out my articles were being \\u201cpirated\\u201d \\u2014 posted on websites under different authors (or even fake personas) without my permission \\u2014 my reaction was nearly identical to that of HBO: go for it. My reasoning is simple: while I don\\u2019t write for pay, I write for a more fulfilling reward: helping to teach others and being able to watch them succeed. Anytime someone reads my articles and learns something, regardless of whether they know I wrote the article, the world is a better place. Maybe this view strikes you as naive and you think I sound idealistic. My response is we could use more idealistic people who do things not for personal gain, but to make enrich the lives of their fellow humans. Sure, I could complain about my work being stolen (freebooted), but unauthorized reposting of my articles will happen no matter how zealously I try to stop it. Instead of wasting my time and energy, I\\u2019ve decided to embrace this stealing, not because I think you should take things that aren\\u2019t yours, but because it only benefits the data science community. Therefore, here it is: go ahead and steal my work if you so desire. Spread it far and wide with or without my name attached! The Google Chrome Extension Sci-Hub links is one of my favorite tools. If you end up on a locked journal article with a Document Identification Number (DOI), click on the extension and magically get transported to the PDF. This access is provided through Sci-Hub, a quasi-legal repository of paywalled journal articles and books that aims \\u201cto remove all barriers in the way of science.\\u201d Whether or not you think this is legal, you can\\u2019t argue with the idea that there should not be arbitrary barriers to advancing human progress. What I love about data science is how accessible it is: there are no insurmountable impediments\\u2014 such as a need for college \\u2014 that prevent you from entering and contributing to the field. You can learn everything you need online and take free courses teaching cutting-edge techniques. This is an unalloyed good for data science, and it is part of my responsibility as a practicing data scientist to ensure it becomes even more accessible. While I could have continued on an academic path and written articles read by a dozen people at most, I decided this would not be satisfying because I wouldn\\u2019t be able to help the general public get into data science. I\\u2019m not denigrating academics, and basic research certainly benefits the public once it filters down into accessible tools (such as Scikit-Learn for machine learning or Keras for deep learning). Nonetheless, I think academics should do more to make their work understandable to the public. Science is most effective when it can change people\\u2019s minds and that always comes down to communication. Neil deGrasse Tyson is the best-known physicist in the world, not because he does the most advanced work, but because he has made it his career to communicate physics findings to a wide audience. The general public clearly has a desire to behold the wonders of physic \\u2014 look at the popularity of Cosmos \\u2014 but don\\u2019t want to spend hours trying to decipher esoteric papers. In much the same way, there is an insatiable hunger to learn data science but people don\\u2019t have the time to read through all the journal articles (most of which will be obsolete in a few years anyway) or the resources to attend college. Fortunately, there are many data science communicators working to tear down those barriers. The biggest hurdle to getting starting in most technical fields is access; however, in data science, everyone has access to the most up-to-date methods and technology (such as TPUs through Google Colab). The next hurdle is the vocab, it\\u2019s easy to get discouraged when you can\\u2019t understand what anyone is talking about. In my opinion, there is no need to use a long word when several shorter ones can better explain the concept. Using longer words doesn\\u2019t make you sound smarter, it just means whatever you say will be inaccessible to most people. Sure you may be technically right and feel a brief moment of superiority, but if no one understands you, they will quickly stop listening. Ultimately, I view it as my responsibility to encourage and help as many people as I can learn data science. I believe a field only grows stronger the more different people that can participate. Data science holds an immense amount of power in a data-driven world, but if that power is wielded by a small group of people, the benefits will be limited. Again, this may be my idealism, but this is the foundational belief that gets me out of bed in the morning. The short answer: anything. The slightly longer answer: I would prefer you didn\\u2019t run my articles with ads (thanks Medium, the subscription model is much better!) but even if you do, I\\u2019m not going to stop you. A credit is nice or a link to the original article, but again, it doesn\\u2019t really matter if you forget. You can copy and paste my articles anywhere (if you want to print a book version that would be neat) and translate them into any language you speak! Fundamentally, I don\\u2019t believe I really own my articles. Sure, I spend dozens of hours writing the code, making Jupyter Notebooks, writing articles, and going through the painful process of editing, but the ideas I\\u2019m using are gathered from many different people and I can\\u2019t claim sole responsibility. As Thomas Jefferson put it \\u201c Knowledge is like a candle. Even as it lights a new candle, the strength of the original flame is not diminished.\\u201d (The original quote was slightly different). In the case of my articles being spread without my consent, I\\u2019m no worse off as a result, and the data science community is better. If we are being honest, my articles should read: \\u201cwritten by the data science community for the data science community.\\u201d Sure, it\\u2019s nice to get recognition, but it\\u2019s even better to know that your work is helping people even if they don\\u2019t know you wrote it.

Jupyter Notebook Extensions are simple add-ons which can significantly improve your productivity in the notebook environment. They automate tedious tasks such as formatting code or add features like creating a table of contents. While there are numerous existing extensions, we can also write our own extension to do extend the functionality of Jupyter. In this article, we\\u2019ll see how to write a Jupyter Notebook extension that adds a default cell to the top of each new notebook which is useful when there are libraries you find yourself importing into every notebook. If you want the background on extensions, then check out this article. The complete code for this extension is available on GitHub. The final outcome of the Default cell extension is shown below: (If you don\\u2019t yet have Jupyter Extensions, check out this article or just run the following code in a command prompt: pip install jupyter_contrib_nbextensions && jupyter contrib nbextensions install and then start a new notebook server and navigate to the extensions tab). Unfortunately, there\\u2019s not much official documentation on writing your own extension. My tactic was to read the other extensions, copy and paste copiously, and experiment until I figured it out. This Stack Overflow question and answer provided the basic code for this extension. There are 3 parts (at minimum) to any Jupyter Notebook extension: (We can also have more functions in other files or css for styling). These 3 files should live in a single directory which we\\u2019ll call default_cell . This folder, in turn, needs to be in the nbextensions subdirectory of the jupyter_contrib_extensions library (what you installed with pip. To find the location of a library installed with pip run pip view package. ) My jupyter_contrib_extensions directory is: So the file structure looks like (with nbextensions as shown above): When you run jupyter notebook, Jupyter looks in this location for extensions, and shows them on the extensions tab on the server: When you make a change to the extension files while developing and you want to see the effects in a Jupyter Notebook,you need to run the command jupyter contrib nbextensions install to rewrite the Jupyter config files. Then, restart the notebook server to see your changes. With the details out of the way, let\\u2019s go through the three files we need. YAML (YAML Ain\\u2019t Markup Language) is a human-readable standard for writing configuration and header files. The YAML file describes the extension to the Jupyter Extensions Configurator to be rendered on the extensions tab. This is a fairly easy file to copy + paste and modify to our needs. This is then rendered nicely on the NBExtensions tab in the notebook: The compatibility indicates the versions of Jupyter for which the extension works. I just added all of them (3.x \\u2014 6.x) and it seemed to work fine! This is the heart of the application where the actual logic for the extension lives. Jupyter Notebooks are run in the browser, which means that extensions must be written in Javascript, the language of the web. It can be a little difficult to figure out what commands to use to make the notebook do what you want. One way to experiment is using the Chrome developer tools (cntrl + shift + i on Windows) or right-click > inspect. With the developer tools open, we can use the console tab to run commands. Try opening the developer tools in a Jupyter Notebook and play with options that start with Jupyter.notebook. Any commands you enter will have to be in Javascript. An example of this behavior can be seen in the clip below. I open up the developer tools and then run a few commands to execute cells, insert a new cell, and select the previous cell. Developing the Javascript code required a lot of experimenting like this! It also helps to read the other extensions to figure out what you need to do. The final main.js is below: The most important part of the code is the add_cell function. This adds a code cell above the currently selected cell with the python code written in the parenthesis (in the set_text call). This is where the default code cell should be defined. The function then executes the cell and selects the one below. The load_ipython_extension function first checks the number of cells in the notebook. If there is only one cell \\u2014 a new notebook \\u2014 it calls the add_cell function which places the default cell at the top of the notebook. It then runs the defaultCellButton function which places a button on the Jupyter Notebook toolbar. We can use this button to add and run the default cell above the currently selected cell. This could be useful when we have an already started notebook and we want our normal imports. There is an almost unlimited number of tasks we could accomplish with Javascript in the browser. This is only a simple application, but there are many more complex Jupyter extensions (such as the Variable Inspector) that demonstrate more of the capabilities. We can also write applications in Javascript that call on Python scripts for even greater control. A readme markdown file should be familiar to anyone with even a little experience programming. Here is where we explain what our application does and how to use it. This is displayed on the extensions tab: (The actual code is pretty boring but for completeness, here it is) Once you have the three required files, your extension is complete. To see the extension working, make sure the default_cell directory is in the correct location, run jupyter contrib nbextensions install and start up a Jupyter Notebook server. If you navigate to the NBExtensions tab, you will be able to enable the extension (if you don\\u2019t have the tab, open a notebook and got to Edit > nbextensions config). Start up a new notebook and see your extension at work: This extension isn\\u2019t life-changing, but it might save you a few seconds! Part of the joy of gaining computer literacy is realizing that if you want to accomplish something on a computer, chances are that you probably can with the right tools and willingness to learn. This small example of making a Jupyter Notebook extension demonstrates that we are not limited by what we get out of the box. We just need a few lines of code to accomplish our goals. Hopefully, either this extension proves useful to you or inspires you to write your own. I have gotten a lot of use from extensions and am looking forward to seeing what else people can develop. Once you do develop an extension, share it so others can marvel at your code and benefit from your hard work. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. The Jupyter Notebook is a great teaching, exploring, and literate programming environment, but out-of-the-box notebooks are notoriously lacking in features. Fortunately, there are a number of ways, including Jupyter Notebook extensions, to improve this invaluable tool. Run the following in a command prompt: Start up a Jupyter Notebook and navigate to the new Nbextensions tab: Enable the extensions you want and enjoy the productivity benefits. (If you don\\u2019t see a tab, open a notebook and click Edit > nbextensions config) The enabled extensions can be seen in the toolbar in a notebook: If that isn\\u2019t satisfying enough for you, below are some details about Jupyter notebook extensions. I\\u2019ve also included my top 5 to get you started. Jupyter Notebook extensions are simple add-ons that extend the basic functionality of the notebook environment. Written in JavaScript, they do things like autoformat your code or send a browser notification when a cell has completed. Extensions currently only work in Jupyter Notebooks (not Jupyter Lab). Why use these extensions? Jupyter Notebooks are great tools for teaching, learning, prototyping, exploring, and trying out new methods (or even in production at Netflix). However, vanilla notebooks are limited in features which can make working in them frustrating. While Jupyter Notebook extensions don\\u2019t completely solve the problem, they do add a few benefits that will make your work easier. Following are the 5 Jupyter Notebook extensions I use most often: Once you start getting dozens of cells in one Jupyter Notebook, it can be difficult to keep track of them all. The Table of Contents solves that problem by adding a linked TOC that can be positioned anywhere on the page: You can also use the extension to add a linked table of contents at the top of the notebook. This even shows which cell is selected and which is running: We should all write pep8 compliant code, but sometimes you get caught up in an analysis and it\\u2019s hard to stick to best practices. When you\\u2019re done writing that amazing plot, this extension allows you to simply click the gavel and automatically format your messy code. Like the best add-ons, this one accomplishes a time-consuming and tedious task with a simple click, enabling you to focus on thinking through problems. The variable inspector shows the names of all variables you\\u2019ve created in the notebook, along with their type, size, shape, and value. This tool is invaluable for data scientists migrating from RStudio or if you don\\u2019t want to have to keep printing df.shape or can\\u2019t recall the type of x. I often find myself trying to figure out how long a cell took to run or when I last ran a notebook that has been open for days. ExecuteTime takes care of both of those by showing when a cell finished and how long it took. There are better methods for timing (such as the %%timeit cell magic) but this is easy to implement and covers all cells in the notebook. Although some of us like to see the hard work that goes into an analysis, some people just like to see the results. The Hide input all extension allows you to instantly hide all the code in the notebook while keeping outputs. The next time someone says they just want to see the results, you have a single click solution. (Although you should always examine the code). These are just the extensions I find myself using the most often and you\\u2019re not limited to five. Check out the whole list by installing the extensions and opening a notebook (the notebook shown here is on GitHub)! (If you are up for it, you can even write your own extension. Documentation is pretty scarce, but here\\u2019s the basic structure.) Install the Jupyter Notebook extensions, spend some time figuring out which ones are useful to you, and improve your productivity. While none of these are life-changing, they all add just enough benefit to be worthwhile, cumulatively saving you hours of valuable development time. Although you\\u2019ll probably want to put some time into learning an IDE if you are writing production code (I\\u2019m liking VS Code), Jupyter Notebooks are still an integral part of a data science workflow. If you are going to be using this environment, you might as well get the most from your tools. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. Life opens up when you learn just how much you can do with Python. The first shift in my daily workflows came when I read Automate the Boring Stuff with Python and saw there were routine tasks \\u2014 such as anything to do with spreadsheets \\u2014 that I no longer had to waste hours on. Instead, I could spend a few minutes writing a Python program (okay maybe a few hours at first), run the script, and then sit back to watch the tedious work do itself. A second shift occurred when I realized that nearly any service with an API \\u2014 Application Programming Interface \\u2014 can be manipulated with Python. Anything you can do in apps like Spotify (Spotipy library), Twitter (python-twitter), Wikipedia (Wikipedia API ), and Slack (Slacker for Python), can be accomplished through Python code. In this article, we\\u2019ll see how to use the Slacker Python library to programmatically interact with Slack. We\\u2019ll be able to retrieve any data from a workspace, alter settings for channels and users, post messages, upload files, create applications, and even monitor machine learning results in real time. The complete code is available as a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. Slacker is a Python interface to the Slack API. It wraps the Slack API service (fully supported by Slack) and allows us to write Python code instead of formatting requests to the API ourselves. This means far less time to construct queries and easier interaction with Slack. The Slack API methods docs are very helpful when using the Slacker library (which has relatively scant documentation). No matter what you want to do in Slack, you can do it through this library as long as you\\u2019re willing to do a little searching! First off, you need to create a Slack workspace. I\\u2019ll assume if you\\u2019re confident writing Python code, you can handle this step by yourself. I\\u2019d recommend making a new workspace where you\\u2019re the admin for testing out interactions. The next step is to get a legacy API token. If you\\u2019re signed into the workspace, head to this link. Make sure to keep your token in a safe location! Authenticate with Slacker using your API token as follows: Check that you\\u2019re connected by printing out the name of the workspace: Anything (okay nearly anything) you can do in slack you can do through the Python interface to the API. (Check out the complete list of methods here). For example, here\\u2019s everything we can do with channels: Let\\u2019s start off with some simple data retrieval. Each time we use a different function in Slacker , we get back a response object where the body holds the results (if the request was successful). There\\u2019s quite a lot of different information we can retrieve. For example, here\\u2019s the channels and purposes: If we want to check out the users (members), here\\u2019s the code and result: It\\u2019s pretty lonely in this workspace! We can search through channels for files or messages, see a channel\\u2019s history, and even look at do not disturb settings: (The user is this case is referred to by id. We can find the user id for a username with slack.users.get_user_id(username)). Not only can we find any information we want, we can also change attributes. Maybe I want to tell my team to leave me alone: I can also alter my profile settings: On the topic of emoji, you can use emoji codes to specify which icon you want. The easiest way to pick these out is to go to Slack, search for the emoji you want, and copy the code that appears: Want to create a new channel and set the purpose? Two lines of python code: Of course we don\\u2019t just want to be passive consumers of information. We want to talk to the world! Fortunately, Slacker lets us easily post to any channel: If we set the username then the messages are posted as bots. We can choose the icon by specifying a url or an emoji. We can also mention specific users with <@user_id> or commit the ultimate sin and notify everyone: Messages can be as complex as we want. Using attachments, we can format messages or even create games! Refer to the Slack API documentation on formatting messages for all the options. You can build complex application workflows with interactive messages. Uploading local files is another one-liner: If we\\u2019ve done some cool analysis and want to share the plots with the team, we save the figures and upload: We can also remove files or messages, add comments, create private chats, invite users, set reminders, and more with the API. Alright, time to get serious and user Slack for some real work. Here we\\u2019ll send messages to monitor the progress of a convolutional neural network (CNN) as it is training. I\\u2019m using a script from Keras to train a CNN to recognize MNIST digits. With custom callbacks in Keras, we can send a message to Slack at the end of every epoch with the current stats. See notebook for full code, but the basic outline is below (this is pseudo-code and won\\u2019t quite run): Now we get real -time deep learning updates in Slack! At the end of training, we can create some training curves and post those: Finally, once our model has trained, we can post predictions from the test set: This model does pretty well! For this simple example, the monitoring might not be necessary, but there are many use cases for tracking a model or posting continuous integration results. I\\u2019ve run models overnight and when I don\\u2019t want to head to the command window to check out the progress, it\\u2019s useful to just look at Slack instead. While apps such as Slack can be used for fun, they also improve productivity when used correctly. Furthermore, if we realize these apps have Python access to their APIs, we can programmatically control them for great efficiency. In this article we saw how to interact with Slack through the Slacker library in Python. This library gives us access to the Slack API which means we have control over nearly every aspect of our workspace. Among other things we can If Slack isn\\u2019t your favorite application (although it should replace your email), check out the list of Python API interfaces. Even if this particular use case is not compelling to you, the idea that we can use Python to complete routine tasks is a powerful one because it enables us to be more efficient. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. It started, as the best projects always do, with a few tweets: This may seem like a simple problem \\u2014 the prevalences are simply the same as the observed data (50% lions, 33% tigers and 17% bears) right? If you believe observations we make are a perfect representation of the underlying truth, then yes, this problem could not be easier. However, as a Bayesian, this view of the world and the subsequent reasoning is deeply unsatisfying. First, how can we be sure this single trip to the preserve was indicative of all trips? What if we went during the winter when the bears were hibernating? We need to include uncertainty in our estimate considering the limited data. Second, how can we incorporate prior beliefs about the situation into this estimate? If we have heard from a friend the preserve has an equal number of each animal, then surely this should play some role in our estimate. In this article, we\\u2019ll explore the problem of estimating probabilities from data in a Bayesian framework, along the way learning about probability distributions, Bayesian Inference, and basic probabilistic programming with PyMC3. The complete code is available as a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. Often, especially in statistics, I find the theory behind a solution more confusing than actually solving the problem. (I\\u2019m convinced statisticians complicate statistics to justify their existence.) Coding an answer and visualizing the solution usually does more for me than reading endless equations. Therefore, when I approached this problem, I studied just enough of the ideas to code a solution, and only after did I dig back into the concepts. This reflects my general top-down approach to learning new topics. Instead of starting with the fundamentals \\u2014 which are usually tedious and difficult to grasp \\u2014 find out how to implement an idea so you know why it\\u2019s useful and then go back to the formalisms. So, if you feel yourself getting frustrated with the theory, move on to the solution (starting with the Inference section below), and then come back to the concepts if you\\u2019re still interested. (This top-down philosophy is exemplified in the excellent fast.ai courses on deep learning. These courses, besides effectively teaching neural networks, have been influential in my approach to learning new techniques.) Since we want to solve this problem with Bayesian methods, we need to construct a model of the situation. The basic set-up is we have a series of observations: 3 tigers, 2 lions, and 1 bear, and from this data, we want to estimate the prevalence of each species at the wildlife preserve. That is, we are looking for the posterior probability of seeing each species given the data. Before we begin we want to establish our assumptions: The overall system, where we have 3 discrete choices (species) each with an unknown probability and 6 total observations is a multinomial distribution. The multinomial distribution is the extension of the binomial distribution to the case where there are more than 2 outcomes. A simple application of a multinomial is 5 rolls of a dice each of which has 6 possible outcomes. A probability mass function of a multinomial with 3 discrete outcomes is shown below: A Multinomial distribution is characterized by k, the number of outcomes, n, the number of trials, and p, a vector of probabilities for each of the outcomes. For this problem, p is our ultimate objective: we want to figure out the probability of seeing each species from the observed data. In Bayesian statistics, the parameter vector for a multinomial is drawn from a Dirichlet Distribution, which forms the prior distribution for the parameter. The Dirichlet Distribution, in turn, is characterized by, k, the number of outcomes, and alpha, a vector of positive real values called the concentration parameter. This is called a hyperparameter because it is a parameter of the prior. (This chain can keep going: if alpha comes from another distribution then this is a hyperprior which could have its own parameters called hyperyhyperparameters!). We\\u2019ll stop our model at this level by explicitly setting the values of alpha, which has one entry for each outcome. The best way to think of the Dirichlet parameter vector is as pseudocounts, observations of each outcome that occur before the actual data is collected. These pseudocounts capture our prior belief about the situation. For example, because we think the prevalence of each animal is the same before going to the preserve, we set all of the alpha values to be equal, say alpha = [1, 1, 1]. Conversely, if we expected to see more bears, we could use a hyperparameter vector like [1, 1, 2] (where the ordering is [lions, tigers, bears]. The exact value of the pseudocounts reflects the level of confidence we have in our prior beliefs. Larger pseudocounts will have a greater effect on the posterior estimate while smaller values will have a smaller effect and will let the data dominate the posterior. We\\u2019ll see this when we get into inference, but for now, remember that the hyperparameter vector is pseudocounts, which in turn, represent our prior belief. A Dirichlet distribution with 3 outcomes is shown below with different values of the hyperparameter vector. Color indicates the concentration weighting. There\\u2019s a lot more detail we don\\u2019t need to get into here, but if you\\u2019re still curious, see some of the sources listed below. Our ultimate goal is to estimate the posterior distribution for the probability of observing each species, p, conditioned on the data and hyperparameters: Our final model, consisting of a multinomial distribution with Dirichlet priors is called a Dirichlet-Multinomial and is visualized below: A summary of the problem specifics is below: If you still want more background details, here are some of the sources I relied on (the first is probably the most valuable): Sources: There are also other ways to approach this problem; see here for Allen Downey\\u2019s solution which yields similar results. Now that we have the model of the problem, we can solve for the posteriors using Bayesian methods. Inference in statistics is the process of estimating (inferring) the unknown parameters of a probability distribution from data. Our unknown parameters are the prevalence of each species while the data is our single set of observations from the wildlife preserve. Our goal is to find the posterior distribution of the probability of seeing each species. Our approach to deriving the posterior will use Bayesian inference. This means we build the model and then use it to sample from the posterior to approximate the posterior with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We use MCMC when exact inference is intractable, and, as the number of samples increases, the estimated posterior converges to the true posterior. The result of MCMC is not just one number for our answer, but rather a range of samples that lets us quantify our uncertainty especially with limited data. We\\u2019ll see how to perform Bayesian inference in Python shortly, but if we do want a single estimate, we can use the Expected Value of the distribution. The Expected Value is the mean of the posterior distribution. For a Dirichlet-Multinomial, it can be analytically expressed: Once we start plugging in numbers, this becomes easy to solve. N is the number of trials, 6, c_i is the observed count for each category, and alpha_i is the pseudocount (hyperparameter) for each category. Setting all alphas equal to 1, the expected species probabilities can be calculated: This represents the expected value taking into account the pseudocounts which corporate our initial belief about the situation. We can adjust our level of confidence in this prior belief by increasing the magnitude of the pseudocounts. This forces the expected values closer to our initial belief that the prevalence of each species is equal. The expected values for several different hyperparameters are shown below: Our choice of hyperparameters has a large effect. If we are more confident in our belief, then we increase the weight of the hyperparameters. On the other hand, if we want the data to have more weight, we reduce the pseudocounts. While this result provides a point estimate, it\\u2019s misleading because it does not express any uncertainty. We only went to the wildlife preserve once, so there should be a large amount of uncertainty in these estimates. With Bayesian Inference, we can get both point estimates and the uncertainty. To get a range of estimates, we use Bayesian inference by constructing a model of the situation and then sampling from the posterior to approximate the posterior. This is implemented through Markov Chain Monte Carlo (or a more efficient variant called the No-U-Turn Sampler) in PyMC3. Compared to the theory behind the model, setting it up in code is simple: Then, we can sample from the posterior: This code draws 1000 samples from the posterior in 2 different chains (with 500 samples for tuning that are discarded). We are left with a trace which contains all of the samples drawn during the run. We use this trace to estimate the posterior distribution. PyMC3 has many methods for inspecting the trace such as pm.traceplot: On the left we have a kernel density estimate for the sampled parameters \\u2014 a PDF of the event probabilities. On the right, we have the complete samples drawn for each free parameter in the model. We can see from the KDE that p_bears<p_tigers<p_lions as expected but there is some uncertainty. A better way to view this uncertainty is through pm.posterior_plot: Here are histograms indicating the number of times each probability was sampled from the posterior. We have a point estimate for the probabilities \\u2014 the mean \\u2014 as well as the Bayesian equivalent of the confidence interval \\u2014 the 95% highest probability density (also known as a credible interval). We see an extreme level of uncertainty in these estimates, as befits the limited data. To quantify the level of uncertainty we can get a dataframe of the results: This shows the best estimate (mean) for the prevalence but also that the 95% credible interval is very large. We can only nail down the prevalence of lions to between 16.3% and 73.6% based on our single trip to the preserve! Bayesian Inference is so powerful because of this built-in uncertainty. In the real-world, data is always noisy, and we usually have less than we want. Therefore, anytime we make an estimate from data we have to show this uncertainty. For this problem, no one is going to be hurt if we get the percentage of bears at the wildlife preserve incorrect, but what if we were doing a similar method with medical data and inferring disease probability? Once we have the trace, we can draw samples from the posterior to simulate additional trips to the preserve. For example, let\\u2019s consider going 1000 more times. How many of each species can we expect to see on each trip? Based on the evidence, there are times when we go to the preserve and see 5 bears and 1 tiger! Granted, this is not very likely, graphs such as these show the entire range of possible outcomes instead of only one. Our single trip to the preserve was just one outcome: 1000 simulations show that we can\\u2019t expect the exact observations every time we go to the preserve. If we want to see the new Dirichlet distribution after sampling, it looks like: What happens when we go 4 times to the preserve and want to incorporate additional observations in our model? In PyMC3, this is simple: The uncertainty in the posterior should be reduced with a greater number of observations, and indeed, that is what we see both quantitatively and visually. Intuitively, this again makes sense: as we gather more data, we become more sure of the state of the world. In the case of infinite data, our estimate will converge on the true values and the priors will play no role. Earlier we discussed how the hyperparameters can be thought of as pseudocounts that represent our prior belief. If we set all the values of alpha equal to 1, we get the results we\\u2019ve seen so far. What about if we decrease or increase our confidence in our initial theory that the prevalence is equal? To do so, all we have to do is alter the alpha vector. Then, we sample from the posterior again (using the original observations) and inspect the results. The hyperparameters have a large influence on the outcome! A lower value means the data itself has a greater weighting in the posterior, while a higher value results in greater weight placed on the pseudocounts. As the value is increased, the distributions converge on one another. We\\u2019d need a lot of data to overcome our strong hyperparameters in the last case. We can compare the posterior plots with alpha = 0.1 and alpha = 15: Ultimately, our choice of the hyperparameters depends on our confidence in our belief. If we have a good reason to think the prevalence of species is equal, then we should make the hyperparameters have a greater weight. If we want to let the data speak, then we can lower the effect of the hyperparameters. Well, what should our final answer be to the question of prevalences? If we are good Bayesians, then we can present a point estimate, but only with attached uncertainty (95% credible intervals): And our estimate that the next observation is a bear? Based on the posterior sampling, about 23%. While these results may not be satisfying to people who want a simple answer, they should remember that the real world is uncertain. The benefits of Bayesian Inference are we can incorporate our prior beliefs and we get uncertainty estimates with our answers. The world is uncertain, and, as responsible data scientists, Bayesian methods provide us with a framework for dealing with uncertainty. Furthermore, as we get more data, our answers become more accurate. As with many aspects of Bayesian Inference, this is in line with our intuitions and how we naturally go about the world, becoming less wrong with additional information. Ultimately, Bayesian statistics is enjoyable and useful because it is statistics that finally makes sense. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

If modern job interviews have taught us anything, it\\u2019s that the correct answer to the question \\u201cWhat\\u2019s your biggest weakness?\\u201d is \\u201cI work too hard.\\u201d Clearly, it\\u2019d be ludicrous to actually talk about our weaknesses, right? Why would we want to mention what we can\\u2019t yet do? While job applications and LinkedIn profile pages don\\u2019t encourage us to disclose our weak points, if we never admit our deficiencies, then we can\\u2019t take the steps to address them. The path to getting better in an endeavor is simple: We rarely get past the first step: especially in technical fields, we keep our heads down and continue working, using the skills we already have rather than attaining new ones that would make our jobs easier or open us up to new opportunities. Self-reflection \\u2014 evaluating ourselves objectively \\u2014 may seem like a foreign concept, but being able to take a step back and figuring out what we could do better or more efficiently is critical to advancing in any field. With that in mind, I\\u2019ve tried to take an objective look at where I am now and identified 3 areas to work on to make me a better data scientist: My purpose in writing this article about my weaknesses in data science is threefold. First, I genuinely care about getting better so I need to admit my weak points. By outlining my deficiencies and how I can address them, my objective is to keep myself motivated to follow through on my learning goals. Second, I hope to encourage others to think about what skills they might not know and how they can work on acquiring them. You don\\u2019t have to write your own article disclosing what you don\\u2019t know, but taking a few moments to consider the question can pay off if you find a skill to work on. Finally, I want to show you don\\u2019t need to know everything to be a successful data scientist. There are an almost unlimited number of data science/ machine learning topics, but a limited amount you can actually know. Despite what unrealistic job applications proclaim, you don\\u2019t need complete knowledge of every algorithm (or 5\\u201310 years of experience) to be a practicing data scientist. Often, I hear from beginners who are overwhelmed by the number of topics they think they must learn and my advice is always the same: start with the basics and understand you don\\u2019t need to know it all! For each weakness, I\\u2019ve outlined the problem and what I\\u2019m currently doing to try and get better. Identifying one\\u2019s weaknesses is important, but so is forming a plan to address them. Learning a new skill takes time, but planning a series of small, concrete steps considerably increases your chances of success. Having received my first real data science experience in an academic environment, I tried to avoid picking up a number of bad habits reflecting an academic way of doing data science. Among these are a tendency to write code that only runs once, a lack of documentation, difficult-to-read code without a consistent style, and hard coding specific values. All of these practices reflect one primary objective: develop a data science solution that works a single time for a specific dataset in order to write a paper. As a prototypical example, our project worked with building energy data that initially came in 15-minute intervals. When we started getting data in 5-minute increments, we discovered our pipelines completely broke down because there were hundreds of places where the interval had been explicitly coded for 15 minutes. We couldn\\u2019t do a simple find and replace because this parameter was referred to by multiple names such as electricity_interval, timeBetweenMeasurements, or dataFreq. None of the researchers had given any thought to making the code easy to read or flexible to changing inputs. In contrast, from a software engineering point of view, code must be extensively tested with many different inputs, well-documented, work within an existing framework, and adhere to coding standards so it can be understood by other developers. Despite my best intentions, I still occasionally write code like a data scientist instead of like a software engineer. I\\u2019ve started to think what separates the average from the great data scientists is writing code using software engineering best practices \\u2014 your model won\\u2019t be deployed if it\\u2019s not robust or doesn\\u2019t fit within an architecture\\u2014 and now I\\u2019m trying to train myself to think like a computer scientist. As usual, there\\u2019s no better method to learn technical skills than practice. Fortunately, at my current job, I\\u2019m able to make contributions both to our internal tooling as well as an open-source library (Featuretools). This has forced me to learn a number of practices including: Even for those data scientists not yet at a company, you can get experience with many of these by working on collaborative open-source projects. Another great way to figure out solid coding practices is to read through source code for popular libraries on GitHub (Scikit-Learn is one of my favorites). Having feedback from others is critical, so find a community and seek out advice from those more experienced than yourself. Thinking like a software engineer requires a change in mindset, but adopting these practices is not difficult if you\\u2019re able to slow down and keep them in mind. For example, anytime I find myself copying and pasting code in a Jupyter Notebook and changing a few values, I try to stop and realize I\\u2019d be better off using a function which, in the long run, makes me more efficient. While I\\u2019m nowhere near perfect on these practices, I\\u2019ve found they not only make it easier for others to read my code, they make it easier for me to build on my work. Code is going to be read more than it\\u2019s written, and that includes by your future self who will appreciate documentation and a consistent style. When I\\u2019m not writing code that is designed to be part of a larger library, I still try to use some of these methods. Writing unit tests for a data analysis may seem strange to a data scientist, but it\\u2019s great practice for when you actually need to develop tests to ensure your code works as intended. Also, there are many linting tools that check your code follows a coding style (I still struggle with the no spaces around keyword arguments). There are many other aspects of computer science I\\u2019d like to work on such as writing efficient implementations rather than brute force methods (for example using vectorization instead of looping). However, it\\u2019s also important to realize you can\\u2019t change everything all at once, which is why I\\u2019m focusing on a few practices and making them habits built into my workflows. Although you can teach yourself everything in data science, there are some limits to what you can put into practice. One is the difficulty in scaling an analysis or a predictive model to large datasets. Most of us don\\u2019t have access to a computing cluster and don\\u2019t want to put up money for a personal supercomputer. This means that when we learn new methods, we tend to apply them to small, well-behaved datasets. Unfortunately, in the real world, datasets do not adhere to strict size or cleanliness limits and you are going to need different approaches to solve problems. First of all, you probably will need to break out of the safe confines of a personal computer and use a remote instance \\u2014 such as through AWS EC2 \\u2014 or even multiple machines. This means learning how to connect to remote machines and mastering the command line \\u2014 you won\\u2019t have access to a mouse and a gui on your EC2 instance. When learning data science, I tried to do work on EC2 machines, either with the free tier or free credits (you can create multiple accounts if you manage all the emails and passwords). This helped get me familiar with the command line, however ,I still didn\\u2019t tackle a second issue: datasets that are larger than the memory of the machine. Lately, I\\u2019ve realized this is a limitation holding me back, and it\\u2019s time to learn how to handle larger datasets. Even without spending thousands of dollars on computing resources, it is possible to practice the methods of working with datasets that don\\u2019t fit in memory. Some of these include iterating through a dataset one chunk at a time, breaking one large dataset into many smaller pieces, or with tools like Dask that handle the details of working with large data for you. My current approach, both on internal projects and open-source datasets, is to partition a dataset into subsets, develop a pipeline that can handle one partition, and then use Dask or Spark with PySpark to run the subsets through the pipeline in parallel. This approach doesn\\u2019t require a supercomputer or a cluster \\u2014 you can parallelize operations on a personal machine using multiple cores. Then, when you have access to more resources, you can adapt the same workflow to scale up. Also, thanks to data repositories such as Kaggle, I\\u2019ve been able to find some extremely large datasets and read through other data scientist\\u2019s approaches to working with them. I\\u2019ve picked up a number of useful tips such as reducing memory consumption by changing the data type in a dataframe. These approaches help make me more efficient with datasets of any size. While I haven\\u2019t yet had to tackle massive terabyte-scale datasets, these approaches have helped me learn basic strategies of working with large data. For some recent projects, I was able to apply the skills I learned so far to do analysis on a cluster running on AWS. Over the coming months, I hope to gradually increase the size of datasets I\\u2019m comfortable analyzing. It\\u2019s a pretty safe bet that datasets are not going to decrease in size and I know I\\u2019ll need to continue leveling up my skills for handling larger quantities of data. Although artificial intelligence has gone through periods of boom and bust in the past, recent successes in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing, and deep reinforcement learning have convinced me deep learning \\u2014 using multi-layered neural networks \\u2014 is not another passing fad. Unlike with software engineering or scaling data science, my current position doesn\\u2019t require any deep learning: traditional machine learning techniques (e.g. Random Forest) have been more than capable of solving all our customer\\u2019s problems. However, I recognize that not every dataset will be structured in neat rows and columns and neural networks are the best option (at the moment) to take on projects with text or images. I could keep exploiting my current skills on the problems I\\u2019ve always solved, but, especially early in my career, exploring topics is an exercise with great potential value. There are many different subfields within deep learning and it\\u2019s hard to figure out which methods or libraries will eventually win out. Nonetheless, I think that a familiarity with the field and being confident implementing some of the techniques will allow one to approach a wider range of problems. Given that solving problems is what drove me to data science, adding the tools of deep learning to my toolbox is a worthwhile investment. My plan for studying deep learning is the same as the approach I applied to turning myself into a data scientist: When studying a technical topic, an effective approach is to learn by doing. For me this means starting not with the underlying, fundamental theory, but by finding out how to implement the methods to solve problems. This top-down approach means I place a lot of value on books that have a hands-on style, namely those with many code examples. After I see how the technique works, then I go back to the theory so I can use the methods more effectively. Although I may be on my own because I don\\u2019t have the opportunity to learn neural networks from others at work, in data science, you\\u2019re never truly on your own because of the abundance of resources and the extensive community. For deep learning I\\u2019m relying primarily on three books: The first two emphasis building actual solutions with neural networks while the third covers the theory in depth. When reading about technical topics make it an active experience: whenever possible, get your hands on the keyboard coding along with what you read. Books like the first two that provide code samples are great: often I\\u2019ll type an example line-by-line into a Jupyter Notebook to figure out how it works and write detailed notes as I go. Furthermore, I try not just to copy the code examples, but to experiment with them or adapt them to my own project. An application of this is my recent work with building a book recommendation system, a project adapted from a similar code exercise in the Deep Learning Cookbook. It can be intimidating trying to start your own project from scratch, and, when you need a boost, there is nothing wrong with building on what others have done. Finally, one of the most effective ways to learn a topic is by teaching it to others. From experience, I don\\u2019t fully comprehend a concept until I try to explain it to someone else in simple terms. With each new topic I cover in deep learning, I\\u2019ll keep writing, sharing both the technical implementation details along with a conceptual explanation. It may feel a little strange proclaiming your weaknesses. I know writing this article made me uncomfortable, but I\\u2019m putting it out because it will eventually make me a better data scientist. Moreover, I\\u2019ve found that many people, employers included, are impressed if you have the self-awareness to admit shortcomings and discuss how you will address them. By identifying my data science weaknesses \\u2014 software engineering, scaling analysis/modeling, deep learning \\u2014 I aim to improve myself, encourage others to think about their weaknesses, and show that you don\\u2019t need to learn everything to be a successful data scientist. While reflecting on one\\u2019s weak points can be painful, learning is enjoyable: one of the most rewarding experiences is looking back after a sustained period of studying and realizing you know more than you did before you started. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. Imagine you and your partner are trying to find the perfect restaurant for a pleasant dinner. Knowing this process can lead to hours of arguments, you seek out the oracle of modern life: online reviews. Doing so, you find your choice, Carlo\\u2019s Restaurant is recommended by a higher percentage of both men and women than your partner\\u2019s selection, Sophia\\u2019s Restaurant. However, just as you are about to declare victory, your partner, using the same data, triumphantly states that since Sophia\\u2019s is recommended by a higher percentage of all users, it is the clear winner. What is going on? Who\\u2019s lying here? Has the review site got the calculations wrong? In fact, both you and your partner are right and you have unknowingly entered the world of Simpson\\u2019s Paradox, where a restaurant can be both better and worse than its competitor, exercise can lower and increase the risk of disease, and the same dataset can be used to prove two opposing arguments. Instead of going out to dinner, perhaps you and your partner should spend the evening discussing this fascinating statistical phenomenon. Simpson\\u2019s Paradox occurs when trends that appear when a dataset is separated into groups reverse when the data are aggregated. In the restaurant recommendation example, it really is possible for Carlo\\u2019s to be recommended by a higher percentage of both men and women than Sophia\\u2019s but to be recommended by a lower percentage of all reviewers. Before you declare this to be lunacy, here is the table to prove it. The data clearly show that Carlo\\u2019s is preferred when the data are separated, but Sophia\\u2019s is preferred when the data are combined! How is this possible? The problem here is that looking only at the percentages in the separate data ignores the sample size, the number of respondents answering the question. Each fraction shows the number of users who would recommend the restaurant out of the number asked. Carlo\\u2019s has far more responses from men than from women while the reverse is true for Sophia\\u2019s. Since men tend to approve of restaurants at a lower rate, this results in a lower average rating for Carlo\\u2019s when the data are combined and hence a paradox. To answer the question of which restaurant we should go to, we need to decide if the data can be combined or if we should look at separately. Whether or not we should aggregate the data depends on the process generating the data \\u2014 that is, the causal model of the data. We\\u2019ll cover what this means and how to resolve Simpson\\u2019s Paradox after we see another example. Another intriguing version of Simpson\\u2019s Paradox occurs when a correlation that points in one direction in stratified groups becomes a correlation in the opposite direction when aggregated for the population. Let\\u2019s take a look at a simplified example. Say we have data on the number of hours of exercise per week versus the risk of developing a disease for two sets of patients, those below the age of 50 and those over the age of 50. Here are individual plots showing the relationship between exercise and probability of disease. (Example can be re-created in this Jupyter Notebook). We clearly see a negative correlation, indicating that increased levels of exercise per week are correlated with a lower risk of developing the disease for both groups. Now, let\\u2019s combine the data together on a single plot: The correlation has completely reversed! If shown only this figure, we would conclude that exercise increases the risk of disease, the opposite of what we would say from the individual plots. How can exercise both decrease and increase the risk of disease? The answer is that it doesn\\u2019t and to figure out how to resolve the paradox, we need to look beyond the data we are shown and reason through the data generation process \\u2014 what caused the results. To avoid Simpson\\u2019s Paradox leading us to two opposite conclusions, we need to choose to segregate the data in groups or aggregate it together. That seems simple enough, but how do we decide which to do? The answer is to think causally: how was the data generated and based on this, what factors influence the results that we are not shown? In the exercise vs disease example, we intuitively know that exercise is not the only factor affecting the probability of developing a disease. There are other influences such as diet, environment, heredity and so forth. However, in the plots above, we see only probability versus hours of exercise. In our fictional example, let\\u2019s assume disease is caused by both exercise and age. This is represented in the following causal model of disease probability. In the data, there are two different causes of disease yet by aggregating the data and looking at only probability vs exercise, we ignore the second cause \\u2014 age \\u2014 completely. If we go ahead and plot probability vs age, we can see that the age of the patient is strongly positively correlated with disease probability. As the patient increases in age, her/his risk of the disease increases which means older patients are more likely to develop the disease than younger patients even with the same amount of exercise. Therefore, to assess the effect of just exercise on disease, we would want to hold the age constant and change the amount of weekly exercise. Separating the data into groups is one way to do this, and doing so, we see that for a given age group, exercise decreases the risk of developing the disease. That is, controlling for the age of the patient, exercise is correlated with a lower risk of disease. Considering the data generating process and applying the causal model, we resolve Simpson\\u2019s Paradox by keeping the data stratified to control for an additional cause. Thinking about what question we want to answer can also help us solve the paradox. In the restaurant example, we want to know which restaurant is most likely to satisfy both us and our partner. Even though there may be other factors influencing a review than just the quality of the restaurant, without access to that data, we\\u2019d want to combine the reviews together and look at the overall average. In this case, aggregating the data makes the most sense. The relevant query to ask in the exercise vs disease example is should we personally exercise more to reduce our individual risk of developing the disease? Since we are a person either below 50 or above 50 (sorry to those exactly 50) then we need to look at the correct group, and no matter which group we are in, we decide that we should indeed exercise more. Thinking about the data generation process and the question we want to answer requires going beyond just looking at data. This illustrates perhaps the key lesson to learn from Simpson\\u2019s Paradox: the data alone are not enough. Data are never purely objective and especially when we only see the final plot, we must consider if we are getting the whole story. We can try to get a more complete picture by asking what caused the data and what factors influencing the data are we not being shown. Often, the answers reveal that we should in fact come away with the opposite conclusion! This phenomenon is not \\u2014 as seems to be the case for some statistical concepts \\u2014 a contrived problem that is theoretically possible but never occurs in practice. There are in fact many well-known studied cases of Simpson\\u2019s Paradox in the real world. One example occurs with data about the effectiveness of two kidney stone treatments. Viewing the data separated into the treatments, treatment A is shown to work better with both small and large kidney stones, but aggregating the data reveals that treatment B works better for all cases! The table below shows the recovery rates: How can this be? The paradox can be resolved by considering the data generation process \\u2014 causal model \\u2014 informed by domain knowledge. It turns out that small stones are considered less serious cases, and treatment A is more invasive than treatment B. Therefore, doctors are more likely to recommend the inferior treatment, B, for small kidney stones, where the patient is more likely to recover successfully in the first place because the case is less severe. For large, serious stones, doctors more often go with the better \\u2014 but more invasive \\u2014 treatment A. Even though treatment A performs better on these cases, because it is applied to more serious cases, the overall recovery rate for treatment A is lower than treatment B. In this real-world example, size of kidney stone \\u2014 seriousness of case \\u2014 is called a confounding variable because it affects both the independent variable \\u2014 treatment method \\u2014 and the dependent variable \\u2014 recovery. Confounding variables are also something we don\\u2019t see in the data table but they can be determined by drawing a causal diagram: The effect in question, recovery, is caused both by the treatment and the size of the stone (seriousness of the case). Moreover, the treatment selected depends on the size of the stone making size a confounding variable. To determine which treatment actually works better, we need to control for the confounding variable by segmenting the two groups and comparing recovery rates within groups rather than aggregated over groups. Doing this we arrive at the conclusion that treatment A is superior. Here\\u2019s another way to think about it: if you have a small stone, you prefer treatment A; if you have a large stone you also prefer treatment A. Since you must have either a small or a large stone, you always prefer treatment A and the paradox is resolved. The second real-life example shows how Simpson\\u2019s Paradox could be used to prove two opposite political points. The following table shows that during Gerald Ford\\u2019s presidency, he not only lowered taxes for every income group, he also raised taxes on a nation-wide level from 1974 to 1978. Take a look at the data: We can clearly see that the tax rate in each tax bracket decreased from 1974 to 1978, yet the overall tax rate increased over the same time period. By now, we know how to resolve the paradox: look for additional factors that influence overall tax rates. The overall tax rate is a function both of the individual bracket tax rates, and also the amount of taxable income in each bracket. Due to inflation (or wage increases), there was more income in the upper tax brackets with higher rates in 1978 and less income in lower brackets with lower rates. Therefore, the overall tax rate increased. Whether or not we should aggregate the data depends on the question we want to answer (and maybe the political argument we are trying to make) in addition to the data generation process. On a personal level, we are just one person, so we only care about the tax rate within our bracket. In order to determine if our taxes rose from 1974 to 1978, we must determine both did the tax rate change in our tax bracket, and did we move to a different tax bracket. There are two causes to account for the tax rate paid by an individual, but only one is captured in this slice of the data. Simpson\\u2019s Paradox is important because it reminds us that the data we are shown is not all the data there is. We can\\u2019t be satisfied only with the numbers or a figure, we have to consider the data generation process \\u2014 the causal model \\u2014 responsible for the data. Once we understand the mechanism producing the data, we can look for other factors influencing a result that are not on the plot. Thinking causally is not a skill most data scientists are taught, but it\\u2019s critical to prevent us from drawing faulty conclusions from numbers. We can use our experience and domain knowledge \\u2014 or those of experts in the field \\u2014 in addition to data to make better decisions. Moreover, while our intuitions usually serve us pretty well, they can fail in cases where not all the information is immediately available. We tend to fixate on what\\u2019s in front of us \\u2014 all we see is all there is \\u2014 instead of digging deeper and using our rational, slow mode of thinking. Particularly when someone has a product to sell or an agenda to implement, we have to be extremely skeptical of the numbers by themselves. Data is a powerful weapon, but it can be used by both those who want to help us and nefarious actors. As always, I welcome discussion and constructive criticism. I can be reached through Twitter @koehrsen_will or on my personal website willk.online. Writing is something that everyone wants to do more of, yet we often find it difficult to get started. We know that writing about data science projects improves our communication abilities, opens doors, and makes us better data scientists, but we often struggle with thoughts that our writing isn\\u2019t good enough or that we don\\u2019t have the necessary background or education. I\\u2019ve struggled with these feelings myself, and, over the past year, have developed a mindset to get through these barriers as well as general principles about data science writing. While there is no one secret to writing, there are practical tips that make it easier to establish a productive writing habit: In this article, we\\u2019ll go through each point these briefly, and I\\u2019ll touch on ways in which I\\u2019ve implemented them to improve my writing. Over the course of dozens of articles, I\\u2019ve made lots of mistakes, and, rather than making these same errors yourself, you can learn from my experiences. The biggest mental obstacle I\\u2019ve had to overcome and what I commonly hear others struggle with is the idea that \\u201cmy writing/data science skills aren\\u2019t good enough.\\u201d This can be debilitating: when considering a project, people will rationalize that since they can\\u2019t achieve perfection, they might as well not even start. In other words, they let the perfect become the enemy of the good. While flawless performance is to be expected is some domains \\u2014 you want your car brakes to work every single time \\u2014 blog writing is not one of these areas. Think about the last time you read a data science article. I\\u2019m guessing (especially if you read one of my articles) it had at least a few errors. However, you probably finished the article anyway because what matters is the value of the content. We\\u2019re willing to overlook a few mistakes as long as the article has compelling content. When I write, I aim to make my articles readable and do several edits, but I have stopped demanding that they be entirely free from errors. In practice, I aim for 90% and anything above that is a bonus. Putting out an article with a few errors is better than putting out none at all (and if you are concerned with grammar / style, I recommend the free tool Grammarly). This attitude extends beyond writing to a data science project itself. There will always be another method you can try or another round of model tuning to carry out. At a certain point, the returns from this work will be less than the time invested. Knowing when to stop optimizing is an important skill. Don\\u2019t let this be an excuse for a half-finished project, but don\\u2019t stress trying to attain an impossible 100%. If you\\u2019ve made a couple mistakes, then you have opportunities to learn by putting your work out for feedback. While the 10,000 hour rule has been debunked (it turns out that focusing while you practice, called \\u201cdeliberate practice\\u201d, matters at least as much as how much you practice) there is something to be said for accumulating more experience at a task. Writing is not an activity requiring special abilities, but rather a process that requires repetition to master. A significant barrier to my writing is getting started, what I like to think of as activation energy. As you write more often, that barrier to beginning is lowered and you reduce the amount of friction needed to start writing. Then once you\\u2019ve started, you\\u2019re usually past the hardest part. If you write consistently, you can change your mindset from \\u201cnow I\\u2019m going to have to take time from this other activity to write \\u201c to \\u201cnow that I\\u2019ve finished the project, it\\u2019s time to write about it as usual.\\u201d Even writing about failed projects can be valuable. Writing about every project reinforces the concept that writing isn\\u2019t an extra chore but a critical part of the data science pipeline. Writing often doesn\\u2019t just mean sharing articles. While you\\u2019re working on an analysis, try adding more text cells explaining your thought process to your Jupyter Notebook. This is how I initially got around to writing a blog: I started annotating my notebooks thoroughly and realized to get to an article was only a little more work. Moreover, when you start adding explanations to your code, your future self and co-workers who look at your work will thank you. Writing my first few articles did feel like a chore, but as I got used to the idea that this wasn\\u2019t going to be a one-off thing, it became much easier until I reached the point where it was an accepted part of my workflow. Habit is extremely powerful, and writing can be acquired like any other habit. Think about the last time you installed a Python package or forked a repo from GitHub. Did you search by authors who had an advanced degree? Did you only look at code written by professional software engineers? Of course not: you looked at the content of the repository before even checking the credentials of the author (if you bothered to at all). The same concept applies to data science articles: they are judged by the quality of the work and not on the author\\u2019s credentials. On the internet \\u2014 for better and occasionally for worse \\u2014 there are no barriers to publishing. There are no arbitrary certificates needed, no ivory tower to climb, no examinations to pass, and no gatekeepers preventing you from learning and writing about anything in data science. While a college degree in something is useful (I have a degree in mechanical engineering and don\\u2019t regret it despite never using it) it is certainly not necessary to contribute to data science. In this excellent article, Rachel Thomas, a professional machine learning researcher gives her opinion as to why an advanced degree is not necessary even in deep learning. Here is a partial list she made of contributors to deep learning without a PhD: In data science, your ability to acquire new knowledge is more important than your education background. If you don\\u2019t feel confident about a subject, then there are a plethora of resources to learn what you need to know. I can personally recommend Udacity, Coursera, and the excellent Hands-on Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and TensorFlow as my favorite resources, but there are countless others. While MOOCS haven\\u2019t fully \\u201cdemocratized education\\u201d in all subjects, they have been successful for data science. Don\\u2019t stop yourself from taking on a project because you think you don\\u2019t have the background. I initially worried about my credentials, but after I thought about it from the reader\\u2019s side \\u2014people don\\u2019t consider the title of someone before reading their article online \\u2014 it became much easier for me to publish without worrying about my background. Also, once you realize that where your education is from doesn\\u2019t matter, you\\u2019ll find it much easier to learn because you can stop thinking of formal education as the only reservoir of information. For data science, you can learn everything you need from the internet, often much quicker than you would be able to in a classroom. It\\u2019s also important to stay open-minded: I try to admit in my articles when I\\u2019m not entirely sure I\\u2019m using the right method and I always welcome any corrections. There is no standard method to do data science but you can still learn a lot from others who have experience solving similar problems. Windows vs MacOS. R vs Python. Sublime vs Atom vs PyCharm. Medium vs your own blog. These arguments are all unproductive. The correct response is to use whatever tool lets you solve the problem (within the confines of your environment). Moreover, the tool with more options is not always better. While more features can sound great, they often get in the way of you doing work. Generally, I try to keep things as simple as possible. When people ask me for recommendations for a writing platform, I say Medium because it has a limited amount of features. When I write, I want to focus on the content instead of spending time trying to format everything exactly as I want. I\\u2019ve gotten stuck in the tool optimization loop before: I\\u2019ve been persuaded to switch to a new technology and spent time to learn the features only to be told that this technology is obsolete and the next thing will make me even more productive. I stopped switching between IDEs (integrated development environments) a while ago and just settled on Jupyter + Sublime Text because I realized the extras were only getting in the way writing code. I\\u2019m not opposed to switching tools when the argument is strong enough, but switching just for novelty is not a recipe for productivity. If you really want to get started, pick a stack and stick with it. If you start a project and notice something missing from your tools, then you can start looking for what you need. Don\\u2019t fall for the flashy new tool promising more features until you know you need those features (this also applies to buying a car). In other words, don\\u2019t let optimization of a work routine get in the way of doing work. Great ideas don\\u2019t emerge on their own, isolated from all others. Instead, they\\u2019re created by applying old concepts to new problems, mixing two existing ideas, or improving upon a proven design. The best way to figure out what to write about is to read what other data scientists are writing. When I\\u2019m stuck on a problem or need some new writing ideas, I inevitably start reading. Moreover, if you aren\\u2019t confident about your writing style, start by emulating your favorite writers. Look at the structure of their articles, and how they approach problems and try to apply the same framework to your project and article. Everyone has to start somewhere, and there is no shame in building on the techniques of others. Eventually you\\u2019ll develop your own writing style which someone else can then adapt and so on. I recommend reading both widely and deeply in order to balance exploration versus exploitation. The explore / exploit problem is a classic in machine learning, particularly in reinforcement learning: we have an agent that needs to balance learning more about the environment, exploring, versus choosing actions based on what it believes will lead to the highest reward, exploiting. I also like to apply the idea of explore / exploit to choosing a data science project. Both extremes can lead to unsatisfactory projects: select a project based only on what you\\u2019ve done in the past, and you might find it stale and lose interest. If you choose a project where you can\\u2019t apply any prior knowledge, then you can get frustrated and give up. Instead, find something in the middle, where you know you can build up those skills you already have, but also need to learn something new. My final advice for choosing a project is to start small. Projects only grow as you work on them, and no matter how much time you allotted to the project, it will take longer (Hofstadter\\u2019s Rule). It might be tempting to take on a complete machine learning project, but if you are still trying to learn Python, then you probably want to tackle one piece at a time. That being said, if you are confident enough to take on an entire project, then go for it! There is no more effective method for learning than practice, especially putting all the pieces together in one problem. As with any activity with delayed long-term rewards, writing can be difficult at times. Nonetheless, there are concrete actions which make the process easier and create positive feedback loops. There is no one secret to writing, but rather a sequence of steps that reduce the friction to get started and help you keep going. As you work to start or advance your data science career, keep these tips in mind to establish and maintain a productive writing habit. I welcome discussion on writing advice, comments, and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Feel free to play around with the code above. This is a simple example, but you can create complex scripts for readers to run in many languages. Besides embedding code in your articles, repl.it has a great discussion forum and interactive exercises to learn coding. I welcome comments, feedback, or constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. When a computation is prohibitively slow, the most important question to ask is: \\u201cWhat is the bottleneck?\\u201d Once you know the answer, the logical next step is to figure out how to get around that bottleneck. Often, as we\\u2019ll see, the bottleneck is that we aren\\u2019t taking full advantage of our hardware resources, for example, running a calculation on only one core when our computer has eight. Simply getting a bigger machine \\u2014 in terms of RAM or cores \\u2014 will not solve the problem if our code isn\\u2019t written to use all our resources. The solution therefore is to rewrite the code to utilize whatever hardware we do have as efficiently as possible. In this article, we\\u2019ll see how to refactor our automated feature engineering code to run in parallel on all our laptop\\u2019s cores, in the process reducing computation time by over 8x. We\\u2019ll make use of two open-source libraries \\u2014 Featuretools for automated feature engineering and Dask for parallel processing \\u2014 and solve a problem with a real-world dataset. Our exact solution is specific for this problem, but the general approach we develop can be utilized to scale your own computations to larger datasets. The complete code implementation is available in a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. If you aren\\u2019t yet familiar with Featuretools, check out the documentation or this article. Here we\\u2019ll focus mainly on using Featuretools with Dask and skip over some of the automated feature engineering details. The primary issue when applying automated feature engineering with Featuretools for the Home Credit Default Risk problem (a machine learning competition currently running on Kaggle where the objective is to predict whether or not a client will repay a loan) is that we have a lot of data which results in a very long feature calculation time. Using Deep Feature Synthesis, we are able to automatically generate 1820 features from 7 data tables and 58 million rows of client information, but a call to this function with only one core takes 25 hours even on an EC2 instance with 64 GB of RAM! Given that our EC2 instance \\u2014 and even our laptop \\u2014 has 8 cores, to speed up the calculation we don\\u2019t need more RAM, we need to make use of those cores. Featuretools does allow for parallel processing by setting the n_jobs parameter in a call to Deep Feature Synthesis. However, currently the function must send the entire EntitySet to all workers \\u2014 cores \\u2014 on the machine. With a large EntitySet, this can result in problems if the memory for each worker is exhausted. We are currently working on better parallelization at Feature Labs, but for now we solve our problem with Dask. The approach is to break one large problem up into many smaller ones and then use Dask to run multiple small problems at a time \\u2014 each one on a different core. The important point here is that we make each problem \\u2014 task \\u2014 independent of the others so they can run simulataneously. Because we are making features for each client in the dataset, each task is to make a feature matrix for a subset of clients. Our approach is outlined below: At the end, we\\u2019ll have a number of smaller feature matrices that we can then join together into a final feature matrix. This same method \\u2014 breaking one large problem into numerous smaller ones that are run in parallel \\u2014 can be scaled to any size dataset and implemented in other libraries for distribution computing such as Spark using PySpark. Our first step is to create small partitions of the original dataset, each one containing information from all seven tables for a subset of the clients. Each partition can then be used to independently calculate a feature matrix for a group of clients. This operation is done by taking a list of all clients, breaking it into 104 sub-lists, and then iterating through these sub-lists, each time subsetting the data to only include clients from the sub-list and saving the resulting data to disk. The basic pseudo code of this process is: 104 partitions was selected based on trial and error and 3 general guidelines: (As an additional point of optimization, we convert the pandas object data types to category where applicable to reduce memory usage. This gets our entire dataset from 4 GB to about 2 GB. I recommend reading the Pandas documentation for category data types so you are using them effectively. Saving all 104 partitions to disk took about 30 minutes, but this is a process that only must be done once. An Entity Set in Featuretools is a useful data structure because it holds multiple tables and the relationships between them. To create an EntitySet from a partition, we write a function that reads a partition from disk and then generates the EntitySet with the tables and the relations linking them. The pseudo code for this step is: Notice that this function returns the EntitySet rather than saving it as we did with the partitions of data. Saving the raw data is a better option for this problem because we might want to modify the EntitySets \\u2014 say by adding interesting values or domain knowledge features \\u2014 while the raw data is never altered. The EntitySets are generated on the fly and then passed to the next stage: calculating the feature matrix. The function feature_matrix_from_entityset does exactly what the name suggests: takes in the EntitySet created previously and generates a feature matrix with thousands of features using Deep Feature Synthesis. The feature matrix is then saved to disk. To ensure we make the same exact features for each partition, we generate the feature definitions once and then use the Featuretools function calculate_feature_matrix. Here\\u2019s the entire function (we pass in a dictionary with the EntitySet and the partition number so we can save the feature matrix with a unique name): The chunk_size is the only tricky part of this call: this is used to break the feature matrix calculation into smaller parts, but since we already partitioned the data, this is no longer necessary. As long as the entire EntitySet can fit in memory, then I found it\\u2019s more time efficient to calculate all of the rows at once by setting the chunk_size equal to the number of observations. We now have all the individual parts we need to go from a data partition on disk to a feature matrix. These steps comprise the bulk of the work and getting Dask to run the tasks in parallel is surprisingly simple. Dask is a parallel computing library that allows us to run many computations at the same time, either using processes/threads on one machine (local), or many separate computers (cluster). For a single machine, Dask allows us to run computations in parallel using either threads or processes. Processes do not share memory and run on a single core and are better for compute-intensive tasks that do not need to communicate. Threads share memory, but in Python, due to the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), two threads cannot operate at the same time in the same program and only some operations can be run in parallel using threads. (For more on threads/processes see this excellent article) Since calculating a feature matrix is compute-intensive and can be done independently for each partition, we want to use processes. The tasks do not need to share memory because each feature matrix does not depend on the others. In computer science terms, by partitioning the data, we have made our problem embarrassingly parallel because there is no need for communication between the workers. If we start Dask using processes \\u2014 as in the following code \\u2014 we get 8 workers, one for each core, with each worker allotted 2 GB of memory (16 GB total / 8 workers, this will vary depending on your laptop). To check that everything worked out, we can navigate to localhost:8787 where Dask has set up a Bokeh dashboard for us. On the Workers tab, we see 8 workers each with 2 GB of memory: At the moment, all 8 workers are idle because we haven\\u2019t given them anything to do. The next step is to create a \\u201cDask bag\\u201d which is basically a list of tasks for Dask to allocate to workers. We make the \\u201cbag\\u201d using the db.from_sequence method and the list of partition paths. Then, we map computation tasks onto the bag. To map means to take a function and a list of inputs and apply the function to each element in the list. Since we first need to make anEntitySet from each partition, we map the associated function to the \\u201cbag\\u201d: Next we doing another mapping, this time to make the feature matrixes: This code will take the output of the first map \\u2014 the EntitySet \\u2014 and pass it to the second map. These steps don\\u2019t actually run the computations, but rather make a list of tasks that Dask will then allocate to workers. To run the tasks and make the feature matrices we call: Dask automatically allocates tasks to workers based on the task graph (a Directed Acyclic Graph) constructed from the mappings. We can view the task graph and status on the Bokeh dashboard as the computation occurs. The set of blocks on the left represent the entity_set_from_partition function calls and the blocks on the right are feature_matrix_from_entityset. From this graph, we can there is a dependency between the two functions but not between feature matrix calculations for each partition. There are a number of other visualizations on the Bokeh dashboard including a task stream (left below) and a profile of operations (right below): From the task stream, we can see that all eight workers are in use at once with a total of 208 tasks to complete. The profile tells us that the longest operation is calculating the feature matrix for each partition. On my MacBook, it took 6200 seconds (1.75 hours) to build and save all 104 feature matrices. That\\u2019s quite an improvement, all from rewriting our code to use our available hardware as efficiently as possible. Once we have the individual feature matrices, we can directly use them for modeling if we are using an algorithm that allows on-line \\u2014 also called incremental \\u2014 learning. Another option is to create one feature matrix which can be done in pure Python using Pandas: The single feature matrix has 350,000 rows and 1,820 columns, the same shape as when I first made it using a single core. Rather than thinking of how to get more computational power, we should think about how to use the hardware we do have as efficiently as possible. In this article, we walked through how we can parallelize our code using Dask which lets us use a laptop to complete a calculation 8 times faster than on a single core. The solution we engineered makes use of a few key concepts: Now we can not only take advantage of the speed and modeling performance of automated feature engineering with Featuretools, but we can use Dask to carry out our computations in parallel and get results quicker. Moreover, we can use the same methods to scale to larger datasets, leaving us well-situated for whatever machine learning problems come our way. If building meaningful, high-performance predictive models is something you care about, then get in touch with us at Feature Labs. While this project was completed with the open-source Featuretools, the commercial product offers additional tools and support for creating machine learning solutions. It can be tempting to call a data science project complete after you\\u2019ve uploaded the final code to GitHub or handed in your assignment. However, if you stop there, you\\u2019re missing out on the most crucial step of the process: writing and sharing an article about your project. Writing a blog post isn\\u2019t typically considered part of the data science pipeline, but to get the most from your work, then it should be the standard last step in any of your projects. There are three benefits to writing even a simple blog post about your work: Writing is one of those activities \\u2014 exercise and education also come to mind \\u2014 that might have no payout in the short term but almost unlimited potential rewards in the long term. Personally, I make $0 from the 10,000 daily views my blog posts receive, each of which takes 3\\u201315 hours to write. Yet, I also wouldn\\u2019t have a full-time data science job were it not for my articles. I know the feeling: you\\u2019ve put up some Jupyter Notebooks or scripts on GitHub and you want to stop and say \\u201cI\\u2019ve done the work, now I\\u2019ll let other people discover it.\\u201d While this might happen in an ideal world, in the real world, getting your projects noticed requires communicating your results. Think about the last time you found a project code repository on GitHub: if you\\u2019re like me, then you read an interesting article about a project and then followed through to the code. People go from an article to the code because first they need a compelling reason to check out the code. That\\u2019s not meant to be cynical, it\\u2019s just the way things work: people aren\\u2019t going to dig into your analysis until they know what you did and why it\\u2019s important/interesting. To give a real-world example, my Data Analysis repo is a collection of numerous data science projects, most written with very rough code. Yet, because I wrote a few articles about some of the projects, it has over 600 stars. While stars are not a great way to measure impact, it\\u2019s clear that people are using this code and finding value in it. Yet, the other day when I stumbled on this repo for Bayesian Optimization of Combinatorial Structures (BOCS) , which objectively has better code than anything I\\u2019ve written, I was shocked to see it had only 2 stars. Much like great ideas die in isolation, the best code will go unnoticed without compelling communication of the results. The value of an analysis is proportional not to using the best algorithm or the most data, but rather to how well you can share the results with a wide audience. In 1854, John Snow helped slow a cholera epidemic in London using 578 data points, a public essay, and a dot map. Rather than hide away his results in a notebook and hope that people stumbled on them, he published his work and made it easily accessible. In the end, he was able to convince the town members to disable a water pump, thereby stopping the spread of cholera and achieving the objective of data science: make better real-world decisions using data. Although data science can be more objective in hiring than other fields, getting a job is still mostly about who you know \\u2014 or who knows of you \\u2014 rather than what you know. The whole point of going to college (only a slight exaggeration here) is not to learn things you\\u2019ll use in your career, but to get to know people and make connections in your intended career field. Fortunately, in data science at this point, while going to college for something is helpful, it\\u2019s not a necessity. With the ability to reach thousands of people online through a blog post, you can form those critical connections and open doors just through the act of writing and sharing\\u2014 with no tuition required. When you write about your projects in a public forum, you can gain access to opportunities that don\\u2019t come just from turning in an assignment. I went to college for mechanical engineering, and didn\\u2019t make a single connection (let alone learn any useful skills) in data science at school. However, I did start writing in my last semester, and as a result, was able to form numerous relationships with potential employers, collaborators, and even book editors (the answer is eventually) that have been immensely helpful as I navigate the start of a data science career. Going back to the first point, my code is nowhere near as good as many other data scientists\\u2019, but I\\u2018ve been fortunate to get opportunities because I\\u2019m able to make my work accessible. While my employer \\u2014 Feature Labs \\u2014 did find my GitHub work, it wasn\\u2019t by searching for \\u201cgreat data science analysis\\u201d on GitHub. Rather, it was through an article I\\u2019d written that walked through a project and summarized the conclusions. Remember, it\\u2019s not code to article, it\\u2019s article to code. A blog post is a great medium for building important connections because it shows that 1. You\\u2019re doing good data science work and 2. You care about sharing it and teaching it to others. Excessive enthusiasm for data science is not a requisite to a job, but showing that you are interested in the field and learning will help attract employers, especially if you are just starting out and don\\u2019t have much experience. Furthermore, well-written blog posts can have a long shelf life, giving you a portfolio for potentially years to come. As a new field, there are rarely any standard answers in data science. The best way to learn is to try something out, make a mistake, and learn from that experience. Putting your work out in a public venue means you can get feedback from thousands of data scientists with thousands of years of collective experience. That\\u2019s the benefit of being part of a community: together, we know more than any one person ever could, and by being a contributing member of that community, you can take advantage of that knowledge by using feedback to improve your own work. Dealing with feedback on the Internet can be tough, but I\\u2019ve found the data science community, and in particular, Towards Data Science on Medium, to be extremely civil. My strategy for dealing with comments is: Unfortunately, we often don\\u2019t take the time to review our own work as often as we should, but, fortunately, we can share it with the world and have other people review it. These other people are probably more honest about our work than we would have been, so we get a more objective assessment by sharing. Although school teaches us to be failure-averse, it\\u2019s only by repeatedly failing and then improving as a result that we get any better. Unequivocally, I\\u2019m a better writer and data scientist because I\\u2019ve put my work out for criticism and listened to the feedback. Right now, you probably have one or a dozen Jupyter notebooks that would make great articles! Take an hour or two to write up one of these and put it out into the world. It doesn\\u2019t have to be perfect: as long as you have done the data science work, people will respect your article. If you struggle with releasing anything that\\u2019s not perfect (one of my largest problems), then set a time limit, say 60 minutes, and whatever you get done in 60 minutes has to be released. I\\u2019ve had to do this a couple times, and it\\u2019s made my resulting work more to the point and more effective. Right now, take one of your Jupyter notebooks, and write an article. Put it out on Medium and then let the community see your work. Although the rewards are not instantaneous, over time the benefits will accrue: Keep working on your data science projects, but don\\u2019t stop at the moment the code goes up on GitHub or is turned in. Take that final step and write an article. Your future self will thank you! As always, I welcome feedback, constructive criticism, and hearing about your data science projects. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. While the technical skills of data science \\u2014 think modeling with a gradient boosting machine \\u2014 get most of the attention, other equally important, general-purpose problem-solving abilities can be overlooked. Proficiency in asking the right question, being persistent, and taking advantage of multiple resources are critical to the success of a data science project but often take a back seat to coding ability when people ask what it takes to be a data scientist. Recently, I was reminded of the importance of these non-technical skills while working on a data science for good project. The project, currently live on Kaggle involves identifying schools in New York City that would most benefit from programs that encourage disadvantaged students to take the Specialized High Schools Admission Test (SHSAT). This task comes with a small data set including test results from 2016, but the organizers encourage the use of any publicly available data. Knowing that the success of a data science project is proportional to the quality and quantity of the data, I set out to find newer test results. Not surprisingly with the vast resources now at our fingertips, I was ultimately successful, and along the way I learned a few lessons about the \\u201cother\\u201d proficiencies necessary for data science that I\\u2019ve laid out below. The broad availability of resources can be both a blessing and a curse: with so many options, sometimes it can be difficult to find a place to start (a phenomenon I see often when people want to learn data science). The right question or goal can help you narrow down the options. If I asked \\u201cIs there any New York City data I can use?\\u201d I would have been overwhelmed with the possibilities, much as people who \\u201cwant to learn Python\\u201d are confronted with a dizzying array of resources (a better objective is \\u201cI want to learn Python for x\\u201d because it will limit the choices). If you don\\u2019t succeed in your initial objective, you can always cast a wider net or change the question / goal. Moreover, sometimes you can answer your initial question with a different set of data than you had in mind or you might find out there was a better question to ask. Keeping this in mind, I set out my search with one question: could I find the most recent results for the SHSAT? With my single focused question, the best place to start was the New York City Open Data Portal. NYC, like many large cities, has an extensive collection of data free to download and use in your projects. Open data portals are a great place to start for exploring issues and using data science to make an impact. Unfortunately, although the NYC data was extensive, none of it covered the SHSAT. So I broadened my search \\u2014 meaning that I went further down the list of Google results \\u2014 and came across an article by the New York Times analyzing exactly the data I wanted (with some great infographics)! Clearly the data was publicly available somewhere if the NYT could get it! Since I had already checked the open data portal, I decided to try a more direct route and contact the author. I\\u2019ve had success with this method before \\u2014 I once scored a free college textbook that was out of print by emailing the author \\u2014 and now it\\u2019s simple to find a social media or professional contact address. As long as your request is civil (a compliment or two doesn\\u2019t hurt) most authors are more than willing to help if they can. However, in this case my direct approach failed as the author didn\\u2019t respond on any the channels I used. To be honest, I don\\u2019t blame her: it can be tough dealing with all the requests you get as a writer, and I would much rather she concentrate on writing more articles than reply to every single comment! One of the most important parts of being a data scientist is the ability to pay attention to details. Valuable information can hide in unexpected places (such as file names) and in this case, reading the fine print under the infographic revealed the source: the NYC Department of Education, which I had already searched through the open data portal! While I had already tried this source, I went back to the portal and decided to make a request from the contact page. I submitted a ticket with the specific data I wanted and received the slightly discouraging note it could take up to 2 weeks to hear a reply. Fortunately, that seems to be a pessimistic overestimate and within 2 days I had a response back \\u2014 from an actual human! \\u2014 that the data I had requested was available. That same day, the full data appeared in the NYC data portal, free for the world to use to the benefit of NYC students. There was no barrier to making the data public, someone just had to ask! Although this project is technically a competition on Kaggle, there was no way I was going to keep the availability of this data a secret. I immediately set up a discussion thread and shared the link to the data source. Within hours, other data scientists were using this data for their own analysis and then sharing their findings. That\\u2019s what\\u2019s great about the data science community: it\\u2019s not about competing, but about learning from each other. One person can only have so much experience but the collective knowledge of a community can be vast. This means that when you find something interesting, don\\u2019t keep it to yourself but rather share it so others can learn as well! Having received so much from other data scientists on Kaggle, it felt great to be able to give a little back. This small example illustrates a few key points: first, it never hurts to ask! I\\u2019ve written about this before, but when you ask someone for a favor (as long as the request is reasonable) the worst they can say is no. Second, the ability to use multiple resources and stay persistent will take you farther than any particular technical skill in your career. None of the steps I took involved any coding, but without going through with them, I wouldn\\u2019t have gotten the data I needed to do an analysis! Finally, don\\u2019t be afraid to reach out to people for help or to use any of the great resources now available to us. As always, I welcome comments, constructive criticism, and discussion. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will In the field of data science, there are almost too many resources available: from Datacamp to Udacity to KDnuggets, there are thousands of places online to learn about data science. However, if you are someone who likes to jump in and learn by doing, Kaggle might be the single best location for expanding your skills through hands-on data science projects. While it originally was known as a place for machine learning competitions, Kaggle \\u2014 which bills itself as \\u201cYour Home for Data Science\\u201d \\u2014 now offers an array of data science resources. Although this series of articles will focus on a competition, it\\u2019s worth pointing out the main aspects of Kaggle: Overall, Kaggle is a great place to learn, whether that\\u2019s through the more traditional learning tracks or by competing in competitions. When I want to find out about the latest machine learning method, I could go read a book, or, I could go on Kaggle, find a competition, and see how people use it in practice. Personally, I find this much more enjoyable and a more effective teaching method. Moreover, the community is extremely supportive and always willing to answer questions or provide feedback on a project. In this article, we\\u2019ll focus on getting started with a Kaggle machine learning competition: the Home Credit Default Risk problem. This is a fairly straightforward competition with a reasonable sized dataset (which can\\u2019t be said for all of the competitions) which means we can compete entirely using Kaggle\\u2019s kernels. This significantly lowers the barrier to entry because you don\\u2019t have to worry about any software on your computer and you don\\u2019t even have to download the data! As long as you have a Kaggle account and an Internet connection, you can connect to a kernel and run the code. I plan to do the entire competition on Kaggle and the kernel (a Python Jupyter Notebook) for this post is available here. To get the most from this article, copy the kernel by creating a Kaggle account, then hitting the blue Fork Notebook button. This will open up the notebook for editing and running in the kernel environment. The Home Credit Default Risk competition is a standard supervised machine learning task where the goal is to use historical loan application data to predict whether or not an applicant will repay a loan. During training, we provide our model with the features \\u2014 the variables describing a loan application \\u2014 and the label \\u2014 a binary 0 if the loan was repaid and a 1 if the loan was not repaid \\u2014 and the model learns a mapping from the features to the label. Then, during testing, we feed the model the features for a new batch of applications and ask it to predict the label. All the data for this competition is structured meaning it exists in neat rows and columns \\u2014 think a spreadsheet. This means we won\\u2019t need to use any convolutional neural networks (which excel at processing image data ) and it will give us great practice on a real-world dataset. Home Credit, the host of the competition, is a finance provider that focuses on serving the unbanked population. Predicting whether or not an application will repay a loan is a vital business need, and Home Credit has developed this competition in the hopes that the Kaggle community can develop an effective algorithm for this task. This competition follows the general idea of most Kaggle competitions: a company has data and a problem to solve, and rather than (or in addition to) hiring internal data scientists to build a model, they put up a modest prize to entice the entire world to contribute solutions. A community of thousands of skilled data scientists (Kagglers) then work on the problem for basically no charge to come up with the best solution. As far as cost effective business plans go, this seems like a brilliant idea! When you go to the competition homepage, you\\u2019ll see this: Here\\u2019s a quick run through of the tabs Although they are called competitions, Kaggle machine learning events should really be termed \\u201ccollaborative projects\\u201d because the main goal is not necessarily to win but to practice and learn from fellow data scientists. Once you realize that it\\u2019s not so much about beating others but about expanding your own skills, you will get a lot more out of the competitions. When you sign up for Kaggle, you not only get all the resources , you also get to be part of a community of data scientists with thousands of years of collective experience. Take advantage of all that experience by trying to be an active part of the community! That means anything from sharing a kernel to asking a question in a discussion forum. While it can be intimidating to make your work public, we learn best by making mistakes, receiving feedback, and improving so we don\\u2019t make the same mistake again. Everyone starts out a beginner, and the community is very supportive of data scientists of all skill levels. In that mindset, I want to emphasize that discussion with others and building on others\\u2019 code is not only acceptable, but encouraged! In school, working with others is called cheating and gets you a zero, but in the real world, it\\u2019s called collaboration and an extremely important skill. A great method for throwing yourself into a competition is to find a kernel someone has shared with a good leaderboard score, fork the kernel, edit it to try and improve the score, and then run it to see the results. Then, make the kernel public so others can use your work. Data scientists stand not on the shoulders of giants, but on the backs of thousands of individuals who have made their work public for the benefit of all. (Sorry for getting philosophical, but this is why I love data science!) Once you have a basic understanding of how Kaggle works and the philosophy of how to get the most out of a competition, it\\u2019s time to get started. Here, I\\u2019ll briefly outline a Python Jupyter Notebook I put together in a kernel for the Home Credit Default Risk problem, but to get the full benefit, you\\u2019ll want to fork the notebook on Kaggle and run it yourself (you don\\u2019t have to download or set-up anything so I\\u2019d highly encourage checking it out). When you open the notebook in a kernel, you\\u2019ll see this environment: Think of this as a standard Jupyter Notebook with slightly different aesthetics. You can write Python code and text (using Markdown syntax) just like in Jupyter and run the code completely in the cloud on Kaggle\\u2019s servers. However, Kaggle kernels have some unique features not available in Jupyter Notebook. Hit the leftward facing arrow in the upper right to expand the kernel control panel which brings up three tabs (if the notebook is not in fullscreen, then these three tabs may already be visible next to the code). In the data tab, we can view the datasets to which our Kernel is connected. In this case, we have the entire competition data, but we can also connect to any other dataset on Kaggle or upload our own data and access it in the kernel. Data files are available in the ../input/ directory from within the code: The Settings tab lets us control different technical aspects of the kernel. Here we can add a GPU to our session, change the visibility, and install any Python package which is not already in the environment. Finally, the Versions tab lets us see any previous committed runs of the code. We can view changes to the code, look at log files of a run, see the notebook generated by a run, and download the files that are output from a run. To run the entire notebook and record a new Version, hit the blue Commit & Run button in the upper right of the kernel. This executes all the code, shows us the completed notebook (or any errors if there are mistakes), and saves any files that are created during the run. When we commit the notebook, we can then access any predictions our models made and submit them for scoring. The first notebook is meant to get you familiar with the problem. We start off much the same way as any data science problem: understanding the data and the task. For this problem, there is 1 main training data file (with the labels included), 1 main testing data file, and 6 additional data files. In this first notebook, we use only the main data, which will get us a decent score, but later work will have to incorporate all the data in order to be competitive. To understand the data, it\\u2019s best to take a couple minutes away from the keyboard and read through the problem documentation, such as the column descriptions of each data file. Because there are multiple files, we need to know how they are all linked together, although for this first notebook we only use the main file to keep things simple. Reading through other kernels can also help us get familiar with the data and which variables are important. Once we understand the data and the problem, we can start structuring it for a machine learning task This means dealing with categorical variables (through one-hot encoding), filling in the missing values (imputation), and scaling the variables to a range. We can do exploratory data analysis, such as finding correlations with the label, and graphing these relationships. We can use these relationships later on for modeling decisions, such as including which variables to use. (See the notebook for implementation). Of course, no exploratory data analysis is complete without my favorite plot, the Pairs Plot. After thoroughly exploring the data and making sure it\\u2019s acceptable for machine learning, we move on to creating baseline models. However, before we quite get to the modeling stage, it\\u2019s critical we understand the performance metric for the competition. In a Kaggle competition, it all comes down to a single number, the metric on the test data. While it might make intuitive sense to use accuracy for a binary classification task, that is a poor choice because we are dealing with an imbalanced class problem. Instead of accuracy, submissions are judged in terms of ROC AUC or Receiver Operating Characteristic curve Area Under the Curve. I\\u2019ll let you do the research on this one, or read the explanation in the notebook. Just know that higher is better, with a random model scoring 0.5 and a perfect model scoring 1.0. To calculate a ROC AUC, we need to make predictions in terms of probabilities rather than a binary 0 or 1. The ROC then shows the True Positive Rate versus the False Positive Rate as a function of the threshold according to which we classify an instance as positive. Usually we like to make a naive baseline prediction, but in this case, we already know that random guessing on the task would get an ROC AUC of 0.5. Therefore, for our baseline model, we will use a slightly more sophisticated method, Logistic Regression. This is a popular simple algorithm for binary classification problems and it will set a low bar for future models to surpass. After implementing the logistic regression, we can save the results to a csv file for submission. When the notebook is committed, any results we write will show up in the Output sub-tab on the Versions tab: From this tab, we can download the submissions to our computer and then upload them to the competition. In this notebook, we make four different models with scores as follows: These scores don\\u2019t get us anywhere close to the top of the leaderboard, but they leave room for plenty of future improvement! We also get an idea of the performance we can expect using only a single source of data. (Not surprisingly, the extraordinary Gradient Boosting Machine (using the LightGBM library) performs the best. This model wins nearly every structured Kaggle competition (where the data is in table format) and we will likely need to use some form of this model if we want to seriously compete!) This article and introductory kernel demonstrated a basic start to a Kaggle competition. It\\u2019s not meant to win, but rather to show you the basics of how to approach a machine learning competition and also a few models to get you off the ground (although the LightGBM model is like jumping off the deep end). Furthermore, I laid out my philosophy for machine learning competitions, which is to learn as much as possible by taking part in discussions, building on other\\u2019s code, and sharing your own work. It\\u2019s enjoyable to best your past scores, but I view doing well not as the main focus but as a positive side effect of learning new data science techniques. While these are known as competitions, they are really collaborative projects where everyone is welcome to participate and hone their abilities. There remains a ton of work to be done, but thankfully we don\\u2019t have to do it alone. In later articles and notebooks we\\u2019ll see how to build on the work of others to make even better models. I hope this article (and the notebook kernel) has given you the confidence to start competing on Kaggle or taking on any data science project. As always, I welcome constructive criticism and discussion and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. As with most interesting projects, this one started with a simple question asked half-seriously: how much tuition do I pay for five minutes of my college president\\u2019s time? After a chance pleasant discussion with the president of my school (CWRU), I wondered just how much my conversation had cost me. My search led to this article, which along with my president\\u2019s salary, had this table showing the salaries of private college presidents in Ohio: While I could have found the answer for my president, (SPOILER ALERT, it\\u2019s $48 / five minutes), and been satisfied, I wanted to take the idea further using this table. I had been looking for a chance to practice web scraping and regular expressions in Python and decided this was a great short project. Although it almost certainly would have been faster to manually enter the data in Excel, then I would not have had the invaluable opportunity to practice a few skills! Data science is about solving problems using a diverse set of tools, and web scraping and regular expressions are two areas I need some work on (not to mention that making plots is always fun). The result was a very short \\u2014 but complete \\u2014 project showing how we can bring together these three techniques to solve a data science problem. The complete code for this project is available as a Jupyter Notebook on Google Colaboratory (this is a new service I\\u2019m trying out where you can share and collaborate on Jupyter Notebooks in the cloud. It feels like the future!) To edit the notebook, open it up in Colaboratory, select file > save a copy in drive and then you can make any changes and run the Notebook. While most data used in classes and textbooks just appears ready-to-use in a clean format, in reality, the world does not play so nice. Getting data usually means getting our hands dirty, in this case pulling (also known as scraping) data from the web. Python has great tools for doing this, namely the requests library for retrieving content from a webpage, and bs4 (BeautifulSoup) for extracting the relevant information. These two libraries are often used together in the following manner: first, we make a GET request to a website. Then, we create a Beautiful Soup object from the content that is returned and parse it using several methods. The resulting soup object is quite intimidating: Our data is in there somewhere, but we need to extract it. To select our table from the soup, we need to find the right CSS selectors. One way to do this is by going to the webpage and inspecting the element. In this case, we can also just look at the soup and see that our table resides under a <div> HTML tag with the attribute class = \\\"entry-content\\\" . Using this info and the .find method of our soup object, we can pull out the main article content. This returns another soup object which is not quite specific enough. To select the table, we need to find the <ul> tag (see above image). We also want to deal with only the text in the table, so we use the .text attribute of the soup. We now have the exact text of the table as a string, but clearly is it not of much use to us yet! To extract specific parts of a text string, we need to move on to regular expressions. I don\\u2019t have space in this article (nor do I have the experience!) to completely explain regular expressions, so here I only give a brief overview and show the results. I\\u2019m still learning myself, and I have found the only way to get better is practice. Feel free to go over this notebook for some practice, and check out the Python re documentation to get started (documentation is usually dry but extremely helpful). The basic idea of regular expressions is we define a pattern (the \\u201cregular expression\\u201d or \\u201cregex\\u201d) that we want to match in a text string and then search in the string to return matches. Some of these patterns look pretty strange because they contain both the content we want to match and special characters that change how the pattern is interpreted. Regular expressions come up all the time when parsing string information and are a vital tool to learn at least at a basic level! There are 3 pieces of info we need to extract from the text table: First up is the name. In this regular expression, I make use of the fact that each name is at the start of a line and ends with a comma. The code below creates a regular expression pattern, and then searches through the string to find all occurrences of the pattern: Like I said, the pattern is pretty complex, but it does exactly what we want! Don\\u2019t worry about the details of the pattern, but just think about the general process: first define a pattern, and then search a string to find the pattern. We repeat the procedure with the colleges and the salary: Unfortunately the salary is in a format that no computer would understand as numbers. Fortunately, this gives us a chance to practice using a Python list comprehension to convert the string salaries into numbers. The following code illustrates how to use string slicing, split , and join, all within a list comprehension to achieve the results we want: We apply this transformation to our salaries and finally have the all info we want. Let\\u2019s put everything into a pandas dataframe. At this point, I manually insert the information for my college (CWRU) because it was not in the main table. It\\u2019s important to know when it\\u2019s more efficient to do things by hand rather than writing a complicated program (although this whole article kind of goes against this point!). This project is indicative of data science because the majority of time was spent collecting and formatting the data. However, now that we have a clean dataset, we get to make some plots! We can use both matplotlib and seaborn to visualize the data. If we aren\\u2019t too concerned about aesthetics, we can use the built in dataframe plot method to quickly show results: To get a better plot we have to do some work. Plotting code in Python, like regular expressions, can be a little complex, and it takes some practice to get used to. Mostly, I learn by building on answers on sites like Stack Overflow or by reading official documentation. After a bit of work, we get the following plot (see notebook for the details): Much better, but this still doesn\\u2019t answer my original question! To show how much students are paying for 5 minutes of their president\\u2019s time we can convert salaries into $ / five minutes assuming 2000 work hours per year. This is not necessarily a publication-worthy plot, but it\\u2019s a nice way to wrap up a small project. The most effective way to learn technical skills is by doing. While this whole project could have been done manually inserting values into Excel, I like to take the long view and think about how the skills learned here will help in the future. The process of learning is more important than the final result, and in this project we were able to see how to use 3 critical skills for data science: Now, get out there and start your own project and remember: it doesn\\u2019t have to be world-changing to be worthwhile. I welcome feedback and discussion and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. The Bayesian vs Frequentist debate is one of those academic arguments that I find more interesting to watch than engage in. Rather than enthusiastically jump in on one side, I think it\\u2019s more productive to learn both methods of statistical inference and apply them where appropriate. In that line of thinking, recently, I have been working to learn and apply Bayesian inference methods to supplement the frequentist statistics covered in my grad classes. One of my first areas of focus in applied Bayesian Inference was Bayesian Linear modeling. The most important part of the learning process might just be explaining an idea to others, and this post is my attempt to introduce the concept of Bayesian Linear Regression. We\\u2019ll do a brief review of the frequentist approach to linear regression, introduce the Bayesian interpretation, and look at some results applied to a simple dataset. I kept the code out of this article, but it can be found on GitHub in a Jupyter Notebook. The frequentist view of linear regression is probably the one you are familiar with from school: the model assumes that the response variable (y) is a linear combination of weights multiplied by a set of predictor variables (x). The full formula also includes an error term to account for random sampling noise. For example, if we have two predictors, the equation is: y is the response variable (also called the dependent variable), \\u03b2\\u2019s are the weights (known as the model parameters), x\\u2019s are the values of the predictor variables, and \\u03b5 is an error term representing random sampling noise or the effect of variables not included in the model. Linear Regression is a simple model which makes it easily interpretable: \\u03b2_0 is the intercept term and the other weights, \\u03b2\\u2019s, show the effect on the response of increasing a predictor variable. For example, if \\u03b2_1 is 1.2, then for every unit increase in x_1,the response will increase by 1.2. We can generalize the linear model to any number of predictors using matrix equations. Adding a constant term of 1 to the predictor matrix to account for the intercept, we can write the matrix formula as: The goal of learning a linear model from training data is to find the coefficients, \\u03b2, that best explain the data. In frequentist linear regression, the best explanation is taken to mean the coefficients, \\u03b2, that minimize the residual sum of squares (RSS). RSS is the total of the squared differences between the known values (y) and the predicted model outputs (\\u0177, pronounced y-hat indicating an estimate). The residual sum of squares is a function of the model parameters: The summation is taken over the N data points in the training set. We won\\u2019t go into the details here (check out this reference for the derivation), but this equation has a closed form solution for the model parameters, \\u03b2, that minimize the error. This is known as the maximum likelihood estimate of \\u03b2 because it is the value that is the most probable given the inputs, X, and outputs, y. The closed form solution expressed in matrix form is: (Again, we have to put the \\u2018hat\\u2019 on \\u03b2 because it represents an estimate for the model parameters.) Don\\u2019t let the matrix math scare you off! Thanks to libraries like Scikit-learn in Python, we generally don\\u2019t have to calculate this by hand (although it is good practice to code a linear regression). This method of fitting the model parameters by minimizing the RSS is called Ordinary Least Squares (OLS). What we obtain from frequentist linear regression is a single estimate for the model parameters based only on the training data. Our model is completely informed by the data: in this view, everything that we need to know for our model is encoded in the training data we have available. Once we have \\u03b2-hat, we can estimate the output value of any new data point by applying our model equation: As an example of OLS, we can perform a linear regression on real-world data which has duration and calories burned for 15000 exercise observations. Below is the data and OLS model obtained by solving the above matrix equation for the model parameters: With OLS, we get a single estimate of the model parameters, in this case, the intercept and slope of the line.We can write the equation produced by OLS: From the slope, we can say that every additional minute of exercise results in 7.17 additional calories burned. The intercept in this case is not as helpful, because it tells us that if we exercise for 0 minutes, we will burn -21.86 calories! This is just an artifact of the OLS fitting procedure, which finds the line that minimizes the error on the training data regardless of whether it physically makes sense. If we have a new datapoint, say an exercise duration of 15.5 minutes, we can plug it into the equation to get a point estimate of calories burned: calories = -21.83 + 7.17 * 15.5 = 89.2 Ordinary least squares gives us a single point estimate for the output, which we can interpret as the most likely estimate given the data. However, if we have a small dataset we might like to express our estimate as a distribution of possible values. This is where Bayesian Linear Regression comes in. In the Bayesian viewpoint, we formulate linear regression using probability distributions rather than point estimates. The response, y, is not estimated as a single value, but is assumed to be drawn from a probability distribution. The model for Bayesian Linear Regression with the response sampled from a normal distribution is: The output, y is generated from a normal (Gaussian) Distribution characterized by a mean and variance. The mean for linear regression is the transpose of the weight matrix multiplied by the predictor matrix. The variance is the square of the standard deviation \\u03c3 (multiplied by the Identity matrix because this is a multi-dimensional formulation of the model). The aim of Bayesian Linear Regression is not to find the single \\u201cbest\\u201d value of the model parameters, but rather to determine the posterior distribution for the model parameters. Not only is the response generated from a probability distribution, but the model parameters are assumed to come from a distribution as well. The posterior probability of the model parameters is conditional upon the training inputs and outputs: Here, P(\\u03b2|y, X) is the posterior probability distribution of the model parameters given the inputs and outputs. This is equal to the likelihood of the data, P(y|\\u03b2, X), multiplied by the prior probability of the parameters and divided by a normalization constant. This is a simple expression of Bayes Theorem, the fundamental underpinning of Bayesian Inference: Let\\u2019s stop and think about what this means. In contrast to OLS, we have a posterior distribution for the model parameters that is proportional to the likelihood of the data multiplied by the prior probability of the parameters. Here we can observe the two primary benefits of Bayesian Linear Regression. As the amount of data points increases, the likelihood washes out the prior, and in the case of infinite data, the outputs for the parameters converge to the values obtained from OLS. The formulation of model parameters as distributions encapsulates the Bayesian worldview: we start out with an initial estimate, our prior, and as we gather more evidence, our model becomes less wrong. Bayesian reasoning is a natural extension of our intuition. Often, we have an initial hypothesis, and as we collect data that either supports or disproves our ideas, we change our model of the world (ideally this is how we would reason)! In practice, evaluating the posterior distribution for the model parameters is intractable for continuous variables, so we use sampling methods to draw samples from the posterior in order to approximate the posterior. The technique of drawing random samples from a distribution to approximate the distribution is one application of Monte Carlo methods. There are a number of algorithms for Monte Carlo sampling, with the most common being variants of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (see this post for an application in Python). I\\u2019ll skip the code for this post (see the notebook for the implementation in PyMC3) but the basic procedure for implementing Bayesian Linear Regression is: specify priors for the model parameters (I used normal distributions in this example), creating a model mapping the training inputs to the training outputs, and then have a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm draw samples from the posterior distribution for the model parameters. The end result will be posterior distributions for the parameters. We can inspect these distributions to get a sense of what is occurring. The first plots show the approximations of the posterior distributions of model parameters. These are the result of 1000 steps of MCMC, meaning the algorithm drew 1000 steps from the posterior distribution. If we compare the mean values for the slope and intercept to those obtained from OLS (the intercept from OLS was -21.83 and the slope was 7.17), we see that they are very similar. However, while we can use the mean as a single point estimate, we also have a range of possible values for the model parameters. As the number of data points increases, this range will shrink and converge one a single value representing greater confidence in the model parameters. (In Bayesian inference a range for a variable is called a credible interval and which has a slightly different interpretation from a confidence interval in frequentist inference). When we want show the linear fit from a Bayesian model, instead of showing only estimate, we can draw a range of lines, with each one representing a different estimate of the model parameters. As the number of datapoints increases, the lines begin to overlap because there is less uncertainty in the model parameters. In order to demonstrate the effect of the number of datapoints in the model, I used two models, the first, with the resulting fits shown on the left, used 500 datapoints and the one on the right used 15000 datapoints. Each graph shows 100 possible models drawn from the model parameter posteriors. There is much more variation in the fits when using fewer data points, which represents a greater uncertainty in the model. With all of the data points, the OLS and Bayesian Fits are nearly identical because the priors are washed out by the likelihoods from the data. When predicting the output for a single datapoint using our Bayesian Linear Model, we also do not get a single value but a distribution. Following is the probability density plot for the number of calories burned exercising for 15.5 minutes. The red vertical line indicates the point estimate from OLS. We see that the probability of the number of calories burned peaks around 89.3, but the full estimate is a range of possible values. Instead of taking sides in the Bayesian vs Frequentist debate (or any argument), it is more constructive to learn both approaches. That way, we can apply them in the right situation. In problems where we have limited data or have some prior knowledge that we want to use in our model, the Bayesian Linear Regression approach can both incorporate prior information and show our uncertainty. Bayesian Linear Regression reflects the Bayesian framework: we form an initial estimate and improve our estimate as we gather more data. The Bayesian viewpoint is an intuitive way of looking at the world and Bayesian Inference can be a useful alternative to its frequentist counterpart. Data science is not about taking sides, but about figuring out the best tool for the job, and having more techniques in your repertoire only makes you more effective! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Sources How to quickly create a powerful exploratory data analysis visualization Once you\\u2019ve got yourself a nice cleaned dataset, the next step is Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA is the process of figuring out what the data can tell us and we use EDA to find patterns, relationships, or anomalies to inform our subsequent analysis. While there are an almost overwhelming number of methods to use in EDA, one of the most effective starting tools is the pairs plot (also called a scatterplot matrix). A pairs plot allows us to see both distribution of single variables and relationships between two variables. Pair plots are a great method to identify trends for follow-up analysis and, fortunately, are easily implemented in Python! In this article we will walk through getting up and running with pairs plots in Python using the seaborn visualization library. We will see how to create a default pairs plot for a rapid examination of our data and how to customize the visualization for deeper insights. The code for this project is available as a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. We will explore a real-world dataset, comprised of country-level socioeconomic data collected by GapMinder. To get started we need to know what data we have. We can load in the socioeconomic data as a pandas dataframe and look at the columns: Each row of the data represents an observation for one country in one year and the columns hold the variables (data in this format is known as tidy data). There are 2 categorical columns (country and continent) and 4 numerical columns. The columns are fairly self-explanatory: life_exp is life expectancy at birth in years, popis population, and gdp_per_cap is gross domestic product per person in units of international dollars. The default pairs plot in seaborn only plots numerical columns although later we will use the categorical variables for coloring. Creating the default pairs plot is simple: we load in the seaborn library and call the pairplot function, passing it our dataframe: I\\u2019m still amazed that one simple line of code gives us this entire plot! The pairs plot builds on two basic figures, the histogram and the scatter plot. The histogram on the diagonal allows us to see the distribution of a single variable while the scatter plots on the upper and lower triangles show the relationship (or lack thereof) between two variables. For example, the left-most plot in the second row shows the scatter plot of life_exp versus year. The default pairs plot by itself often gives us valuable insights. We see that life expectancy and gdp per capita are positively correlated showing that people in higher income countries tend to live longer (although this of course does not prove that one causes the other). It also appears that (thankfully) life expectancies worldwide are on the rise over time. From the histograms, we learn that the population and gdp variables are heavily right-skewed. To better show these variables in future plots, we can transform these columns by taking the logarithm of the values: While this plot alone can be useful in an analysis, we can find make it more valuable by coloring the figures based on a categorical variable such as continent. This is also extremely simple in seaborn! All we need to do is use the hue keyword in the sns.pairplot function call: Now we see that Oceania and Europe tend to have the highest life expectancies and Asia has the largest population. Notice that our log transformation of the population and gdp made these variables normally distributed which gives a more thorough representation of the values. This graph is more informative, but there are still some issues: I tend not to find stacked histograms, as on the diagonals, to be very interpretable. A better method for showing univariate (single variable) distributions from multiple categories is the density plot. We can exchange the histogram for a density plot in the function call. While we are at it, we will pass in some keywords to the scatter plots to change the transparency, size, and edgecolor of the points. The density plots on the diagonal make it easier to compare distributions between the continents than stacked bars. Changing the transparency of the scatter plots increases readability because there is considerable overlap (known as overplotting) on these figures. As a final example of the default pairplot, let\\u2019s reduce the clutter by plotting only the years after 2000. We will still color by continent, but now we won\\u2019t plot the year column. To limit the columns plotted, we pass in a list of vars to the function. To clarify the plot, we can also add a title. This is starting to look pretty nice! If we were going to do modeling, we could use information from these plots to inform our choices. For example, we know that log_gdp_per_cap is positively correlated with life_exp, so we could create a linear model to quantify this relationship. For this post we\\u2019ll stick to plotting, and, if we want to explore our data even more, we can customize the pairplots using the PairGrid class. In contrast to the sns.pairplot function, sns.PairGrid is a class which means that it does not automatically fill in the plots for us. Instead, we create a class instance and then we map specific functions to the different sections of the grid. To create a PairGrid instance with our data, we use the following code which also limits the variables we will show: If we were to display this, we would get a blank graph because we have not mapped any functions to the grid sections. There are three grid sections to fill in for a PairGrid: the upper triangle, lower triangle, and the diagonal. To map plots to these sections, we use the grid.map method on the section. For example, to map a scatter plot to the upper triangle we use: The map_upper method takes in any function that accepts two arrays of variables (such as plt.scatter)and associated keywords (such as color). The map_lower method is the exact same but fills in the lower triangle of the grid. The map_diag is slightly different because it takes in a function that accepts a single array (remember the diagonal shows only one variable). An example is plt.hist which we use to fill in the diagonal section below: In this case, we are using a kernel density estimate in 2-D (a density plot) on the lower triangle. Put together, this code gives us the following plot: The real benefits of using the PairGrid class come when we want to create custom functions to map different information onto the plot. For example, I might want to add the Pearson Correlation Coefficient between two variables onto the scatterplot. To do so, I would write a function that takes in two arrays, calculates the statistic, and then draws it on the graph. The following code shows how this is done (credit to this Stack Overflow answer): Our new function is mapped to the upper triangle because we need two arrays to calculate a correlation coefficient (notice also that we can map multiple functions to grid sections). This produces the following plot: The correlation coefficient now appears above the scatterplot. This is a relatively straightforward example, but we can use PairGrid to map any function we want onto the plot. We can add as much information as needed provided we can figure out how to write the function! As a final example, here is a plot that shows the summary statistics on the diagonal instead of a plot. This needs a little cleaning up, but it shows the general idea; in addition to using any existing function in a library such as matplotlib to map data onto the figure, we can write our own function to show custom information. Pairs plots are a powerful tool to quickly explore distributions and relationships in a dataset. Seaborn provides a simple default method for making pair plots that can be customized and extended through the Pair Grid class. In a data analysis project, a major portion of the value often comes not in the flashy machine learning, but in the straightforward visualization of data. A pairs plot is provides us with a comprehensive first look at our data and is a great starting point in data analysis projects. I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Visualizing One-Dimensional Data in Python Plotting a single variable seems like it should be easy. With only one dimension how hard can it be to effectively display the data? For a long time, I got by using the simple histogram which shows the location of values, the spread of the data, and the shape of the data (normal, skewed, bimodal, etc.) However, I recently ran into some problems where a histogram failed and I knew it was time to broaden my plotting knowledge. I found an excellent free online book on data visualization, and implemented some of the techniques. Rather than keep everything I learned to myself, I decided it would helpful (to myself and to others) to write a Python guide to histograms and an alternative that has proven immensely useful, density plots. This article will take a comprehensive look at using histograms and density plots in Python using the matplotlib and seaborn libraries. Throughout, we will explore a real-world dataset because with the wealth of sources available online, there is no excuse for not using actual data! We will visualize the NYCflights13 data, which contains over 300,000 observations of flights departing NYC in 2013. We will focus on displaying a single variable, the arrival delay of flights in minutes. The full code for this article is available as a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. It\\u2019s always a good idea to examine our data before we get started plotting. We can read the data into a pandas dataframe and display the first 10 rows: The flight arrival delays are in minutes and negative values mean the flight was early (it turns out flights often tend to arrive early, just never when we\\u2019re on them!) There are over 300,000 flights with a minimum delay of -60 minutes and a maximum delay of 120 minutes. The other column in the dataframe is the name of the airline which we can use for comparisons. A great way to get started exploring a single variable is with the histogram. A histogram divides the variable into bins, counts the data points in each bin, and shows the bins on the x-axis and the counts on the y-axis. In our case, the bins will be an interval of time representing the delay of the flights and the count will be the number of flights falling into that interval. The binwidth is the most important parameter for a histogram and we should always try out a few different values of binwidth to select the best one for our data. To make a basic histogram in Python, we can use either matplotlib or seaborn. The code below shows function calls in both libraries that create equivalent figures. For the plot calls, we specify the binwidth by the number of bins. For this plot, I will use bins that are 5 minutes in length, which means that the number of bins will be the range of the data (from -60 to 120 minutes) divided by the binwidth, 5 minutes ( bins = int(180/5)). For most basic histograms, I would go with the matplotlib code because it is simpler, but we will use the seaborn distplot function later on to create different distributions and it\\u2019s good to be familiar with the different options. How did I come up with 5 minutes for the binwidth? The only way to figure out an optimal binwidth is to try out multiple values! Below is code to make the same figure in matplotlib with a range of binwidths. Ultimately, there is no right or wrong answer to the binwidth, but I choose 5 minutes because I think it best represents the distribution. The choice of binwidth significantly affects the resulting plot. Smaller binwidths can make the plot cluttered, but larger binwidths may obscure nuances in the data. Matplotlib will automatically choose a reasonable binwidth for you, but I like to specify the binwidth myself after trying out several values. There is no true right or wrong answer, so try a few options and see which works best for your particular data. Histograms are a great way to start exploring a single variable drawn from one category. However, when we want to compare the distributions of one variable across multiple categories, histograms have issues with readability. For example, if we want to compare arrival delay distributions between airlines, an approach that doesn\\u2019t work well is to to create histograms for each airline on the same plot: (Notice that the y-axis has been normalized to account for the differing number of flights between airlines. To do this, pass in the argument norm_hist = True to the sns.distplot function call.) This plot is not very helpful! All the overlapping bars make it nearly impossible to make comparisons between the airlines. Let\\u2019s look at a few possible solutions to this common problem. Instead of overlapping the airline histograms, we can place them side-by-side. To do this, we create a list of the arrival delays for each airline, and then pass this into the plt.hist function call as a list of lists. We have to specify different colors to use for each airline and a label so we can tell them apart. The code, including creating the lists for each airline is below: By default, if we pass in a list of lists, matplotlib will put the bars side-by-side. Here, I have changed the binwidth to 15 minutes because otherwise the plot is too cluttered, but even with this modification, this is not an effective figure. There is too much information to process at once, the bars don\\u2019t align with the labels, and it\\u2019s still hard to compare distributions between airlines. When we make a plot, we want it to be as easy for the viewer to understand as possible, and this figure fails by that criteria! Let\\u2019s look at a second potential solution. Instead of plotting the bars for each airline side-by-side, we can stack them by passing in the parameter stacked = True to the histogram call: Well, that definitely is not any better! Here, each airline is represented as a section of the whole for each bin, but it\\u2019s nearly impossible to make comparisons. For example, at a delay of -15 to 0 minutes, does United Air Lines or JetBlue Airlines have a larger size of the bar? I can\\u2019t tell and viewers won\\u2019t be able to either. I generally am not a proponent of stacked bars because they can be difficult to interpret (although there are use cases such as when visualizing proportions). Both of the solutions we tried using histograms were not successful, and so it\\u2019s time to move to the density plot. First, what is a density plot? A density plot is a smoothed, continuous version of a histogram estimated from the data. The most common form of estimation is known as kernel density estimation. In this method, a continuous curve (the kernel) is drawn at every individual data point and all of these curves are then added together to make a single smooth density estimation. The kernel most often used is a Gaussian (which produces a Gaussian bell curve at each data point). If, like me, you find that description a little confusing, take a look at the following plot: Here, each small black vertical line on the x-axis represents a data point. The individual kernels (Gaussians in this example) are shown drawn in dashed red lines above each point. The solid blue curve is created by summing the individual Gaussians and forms the overall density plot. The x-axis is the value of the variable just like in a histogram, but what exactly does the y-axis represent? The y-axis in a density plot is the probability density function for the kernel density estimation. However, we need to be careful to specify this is a probability density and not a probability. The difference is the probability density is the probability per unit on the x-axis. To convert to an actual probability, we need to find the area under the curve for a specific interval on the x-axis. Somewhat confusingly, because this is a probability density and not a probability, the y-axis can take values greater than one. The only requirement of the density plot is that the total area under the curve integrates to one. I generally tend to think of the y-axis on a density plot as a value only for relative comparisons between different categories. To make density plots in seaborn, we can use either the distplot or kdeplot function. I will continue to use the distplot function because it lets us make multiple distributions with one function call. For example, we can make a density plot showing all arrival delays on top of the corresponding histogram: The curve shows the density plot which is essentially a smooth version of the histogram. The y-axis is in terms of density, and the histogram is normalized by default so that it has the same y-scale as the density plot. Analogous to the binwidth of a histogram, a density plot has a parameter called the bandwidth that changes the individual kernels and significantly affects the final result of the plot. The plotting library will choose a reasonable value of the bandwidth for us (by default using the \\u2018scott\\u2019 estimate), and unlike the binwidth of a histogram, I usually use the default bandwidth. However, we can look at using different bandwidths to see if there is a better choice. In the plot, \\u2018scott\\u2019 is the default, which looks like the best option. Notice that a wider bandwidth results in more smoothing of the distribution. We also see that even though we limited our data to -60 to 120 minutes, the density plot extends beyond these limits. This is one potential issue with a density plot: because it calculates a distribution at each data point, it can generate data that falls outside the bounds of the original data. This might mean that we end up with impossible values on the x-axis that were never present in the original data! As a note, we can also change the kernel, which changes the distribution drawn at each data point and thus the overall distribution. However, for most applications, the default kernel, Gaussian, and the default bandwidth estimation work very well. Now that we understand how a density plot is made and what it represents, let\\u2019s see how it can solve our problem of visualizing the arrival delays of multiple airlines. To show the distributions on the same plot, we can iterate through the airlines, each time calling distplot with the kernel density estimate set to True and the histogram set to False. The code to draw the density plot with multiple airlines is below: Finally, we have arrived at an effective solution! With the density plot, we can easily make comparisons between airlines because the plot is less cluttered. Now that we finally have the plot we want, we come to the conclusion that all these airlines have nearly identical arrival delay distributions! However, there are other airlines in the dataset, and we can plot one that is a little different to illustrate another optional parameter for density plots, shading the graph. Filling in the density plot can help us to distinguish between overlapping distributions. Although this is not always a good approach, it can help to emphasize the difference between distributions. To shade the density plots, we pass in shade = True to the kde_kws argument in the distplot call. Whether or not to shade the plot is, like other plotting options, a question that depends on the problem! For this graph, I think it makes sense because the shading helps us distinguish the plots in the regions where they overlap. Now, we finally have some useful information: Alaska Airlines flights tend to be earlier more often than United Airlines. The next time you have the option, you know which airline to choose! If you want to show every value in a distribution and not just the smoothed density, you can add a rug plot. This shows every single data point on the x-axis, allowing us to visualize all of the actual values. The benefit of using seaborn\\u2019s distplot is that we can add the rug plot with a single parameter call of rug = True (with some formatting as well). With many data points the rug plot can become overcrowded, but for some datasets, it can be helpful to view every data point. The rug plot also lets us see how the density plot \\u201ccreates\\u201d data where none exists because it makes a kernel distribution at each data point. These distributions can leak over the range of the original data and give the impression that Alaska Airlines has delays that are both shorter and longer than actually recorded. We need to be careful about this artifact of density plots and point it out to viewers! This post has hopefully given you a range of options for visualizing a single variable from one or multiple categories. There are even more univariate (single variable) plots we can make such as empirical cumulative density plots and quantile-quantile plots, but for now we will leave it at histograms and density plots (and rug plots too!). Don\\u2019t worry if the options seem overwhelming: with practice, making a good choice will become easier, and you can always ask for help if needed. Moreover, often there isn\\u2019t an optimal choice and the \\u201cright\\u201d decision will come down to preference and the objectives of the visualization. The good thing is, no matter what plot you want to make, there is going to be a way to do it in Python! Visualizations are an effective means for communicating results, and knowing all the options available allows us to choose the right figure for our data. I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Moving beyond static plots In the first part of this series, we walked through creating a basic histogram in Bokeh, a powerful Python visualization library. The final result, which shows the distribution of arrival delays of flights departing New York City in 2013 is shown below (with a nice tooltip!): This chart gets the job done, but it\\u2019s not very engaging! Viewers can see the distribution of flight delays is nearly normal (with a slight positive skew), but there\\u2019s no reason for them to spend more than a few seconds with the figure. If we want to create more engaging visualization, we can allow users to explore the data on their own through interactions. For example, in this histogram, one valuable feature would be the ability to select specific airlines to make comparisons or the option to change the width of the bins to examine the data in finer detail. Fortunately, these are both features we can add on top of our existing plot using Bokeh. The initial development of the histogram may have seemed involved for a simple plot, but now we get to see the payoff of using a powerful library like Bokeh! All the code for this series is available on GitHub. I encourage anyone to check it out for all the data cleaning details (an uninspiring but necessary part of data science) and to experiment with the code!(For interactive Bokeh plots, we can still use a Jupyter Notebook to show the results or we can write Python scripts and run a Bokeh server. For development, I usually work in a Jupyter Notebook because it is easier to rapidly iterate and change plots without having to restart the server. I then move to a server to display the final results. You can see both a standalone script and the full notebook on GitHub.) There are two classes of interactions in Bokeh: passive and active. Passive interactions, covered in Part I, are also known as inspectors because they allow users to examine a plot in more detail but do not change the information displayed. One example is a tooltip that appears when a user hovers over a data point: The second class of interaction is called active because it changes the actual data displayed on the plot. This can be anything from selecting a subset of the data (such as specific airlines) to changing the degree of a polynomial regression fit. There are multiple types of active interactions in Bokeh, but here we will focus on what are called \\u201cwidgets\\u201d, elements that can be clicked on and that give the user control over some aspect of the plot. When I view graphs, I enjoy playing with active interactions (such as those on FlowingData) because they allow me to do my own exploration of the data. I find it more insightful to discover conclusions from the data on my own (with some direction from the designer) rather than from a completely static chart. Moreover, giving users some amount of freedom allows them to come away with slightly different interpretations that can generate beneficial discussion about the dataset. Once we start adding active interactions, we need to move beyond single lines of code and into functions that encapsulate specific actions. For a Bokeh widget interaction, there are three main functions that to implement: Before we can make the plot, we need to plan out the data that will be displayed. For our interactive histogram, we will offer users three controllable parameters: For the function that makes the dataset for the plot, we need to allow each of these parameters to be specified. To inform how we will transform the data in our make_dataset function, lets load in all the relevant data and inspect. In this dataset, each row is one separate flight. The arr_delaycolumn is the arrival delay of the flight in minutes (negative numbers means the flight was early). In part I, we did some data exploration and know there are 327,236 flights with a minimum delay of -86 minutes and a maximum delay of +1272 minutes. In the make_datasetfunction, we will want to select airlines based on the name column in the dataframe and limit the flights by the arr_delay column. To make the data for the histogram, we use the numpy function histogram which counts the number of data points in each bin. In our case, this is the number of flights in each specified delay interval. For part I, we made a histogram for all flights, but now we will do it by each carrier. As the number of flights for each carrier varies significantly, we can display the delays not in raw counts but in proportions. That is, the height on the plot corresponds to the fraction of all flights for a specific airline with a delay in the corresponding bin. To go from counts to a proportion, we divide the count by the total count for the airline. Below is the full code for making the dataset. The function takes in a list of carriers that we want to include, the minimum and maximum delays to be plotted, and the specified bin width in minutes. (I know this is a post about Bokeh, but you can\\u2019t make a graph without formatted data, so I included the code to demonstrate my methods!) The results of running the function with all of the carriers is below: As a reminder, we are using the Bokeh quad glyphs to make the histogram and so we need to provide the left, right, and top of the glyph (the bottom will be fixed at 0). These are in the left, right, and proportion columns respectively. The color column gives each carrier a unique color and the f_ columns provide formatted text for the tooltips. The next function to implement is make_plot. The function should take in a ColumnDataSource (a specific type of object used in Bokeh for plotting) and return the plot object: If we pass in a source with all airlines, this code gives us the following plot: This histogram is very cluttered because there are 16 airlines plotted on the same graph! If we want to compare airlines, it\\u2019s nearly impossible because of the overlapping information. Luckily, we can add widgets to make the plot clearer and enable quick comparisons. Once we create a basic figure in Bokeh adding in interactions via widgets is relatively straightforward. The first widget we want is a selection box that allows viewers to select airlines to display. This control will be a check box which allows as many selections as desired and is known in Bokeh as a CheckboxGroup. To make the selection tool, we import the CheckboxGroup class and create an instance with two parameters, labels: the values we want displayed next to each box and active: the initial boxes which are checked. Here is the code to create a CheckboxGroup with all carriers. The labels in a Bokeh checkbox must be strings, while the active values are integers. This means that in the image \\u2018AirTran Airways Corporation\\u2019 maps to the active value of 0 and \\u2018Alaska Airlines Inc.\\u2019 maps to the active value of 1. When we want to match the selected checkboxes to the airlines, we need to make sure to find the string names associated with the selected integer active values. We can do this using the .labels and .active attributes of the widget: After making the selection widget, we now need to link the selected airline checkboxes to the information displayed on the graph. This is accomplished using the .on_change method of the CheckboxGroup and an update function that we define. The update function always takes three arguments: attr, old, new and updates the plot based on the selection controls. The way we change the data displayed on the graph is by altering the data source that we passed to the glyph(s) in the make_plot function. That might sound a little abstract, so here\\u2019s an example of an update function that changes the histogram to display the selected airlines: Here, we are retrieving the list of airlines to display based on the selected airlines from the CheckboxGroup. This list is passed to the make_datasetfunction which returns a new column data source. We update the data of the source used in the glyphs by calling src.data.update and passing in the data from the new source. Finally, in order to link changes in the carrier_selection widget to the update function, we have to use the .on_change method (called an event handler). This calls the update function any time a different airline is selected or unselected. The end result is that only glyphs corresponding to the selected airlines are drawn on the histogram, which can be seen below: Now that we know the basic workflow for creating a control we can add in more elements. Each time, we create the widget, write an update function to change the data displayed on the plot, and link the update function to the widget with an event handler. We can even use the same update function for multiple elements by rewriting the function to extract the values we need from the widgets. To practice, we will add two additional controls: a Slider which selects the bin width for the histogram, and a RangeSlider that sets the minimum and maximum delays to display. Here\\u2019s the code to make both of these widgets and the new update function: The standard slider and the range slider are shown here: If we want, we can also change other aspects of the plot besides the data displayed using the update function. For example, to change the title text to match the bin width we can do: There are many other types of interactions in Bokeh, but for now, our three controls allow users plenty to \\u201cplay\\u201d with on the chart! All the elements for our interactive plot are in place. We have the three necessary functions: make_dataset, make_plot, and update to change the plot based on the controls and the widgets themselves. We join all of these elements onto one page by defining a layout. I put the entire layout onto a tab, and when we make a full application, we can put each plot on a separate tab. The final result of all this work is below: Feel free to check out the code and plot for yourself on GitHub. The next part of this series will look at how we can make a complete application with multiple plots. We will be able to show our work on a server and access it in a browser, creating a full dashboard to explore the dataset. We can see that the final interactive plot is much more useful than the original! We can now compare delays between airlines and change the bin widths/ranges to see how the distribution is affected. Adding interactivity raises the value of a plot because it increases engagement with the data and allows users to arrive at conclusions through their own explorations. Although setting up the initial plot was involved, we saw how we could easily add elements and control widgets to an existing figure. The customizability of plots and interactions are the benefits of using a heavier plotting library like Bokeh compared to something quick and simple like matplotlib. Different visualization libraries have different advantages and use-cases, but when we want to add the extra dimension of interaction, Bokeh is a great choice. Hopefully at this point you are confident enough to start developing your own visualizations, and please share anything you create! I welcome feedback and constructive criticism and can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Elevate your visualization game The most sophisticated statistical analysis can be meaningless without an effective means for communicating the results. This point was driven home by a recent experience I had on my research project, where we use data science to improve building energy efficiency. For the past several months, one of my team members has been working on a technique called wavelet transforms which is used to analyze the frequency components of a time-series. The method achieves positive results, but she was having trouble explaining it without getting lost in the technical details. Exasperated, she asked me if I could make a visual showing the transformation. In a couple minutes using an R package called gganimate, I made a simple animation showing how the method transforms a time-series. Now, instead of struggling to explain wavelets, my team member can show the clip to provide an intuitive idea of how the technique works. My conclusion was we can do the most rigorous analysis, but at the end of the day, all people want to see is a gif! While this statement is meant to be humorous, it has an element of truth: results will have little impact if they cannot be clearly communicated, and often the best way for presenting the results of an analysis is with visualizations. The resources available for data science are advancing rapidly which is especially pronounced in the realm of visualization where it seems there is another option to try every week. With all these advances there is one common trend: increased interactivity. People like to see data in static graphs but what they enjoy even more is playing with the data to see how changing parameters affects the results. With regards to my research, a report telling a building owner how much electricity they can save by changing their AC schedule is nice, but it\\u2019s more effective to give them an interactive graph where they can choose different schedules and see how their choice affects electricity consumption. Recently, inspired by the trend towards interactive plots and a desire to keep learning new tools, I have been working with Bokeh, a Python library. An example of the interactive capabilities of Bokeh are shown in this dashboard I built for my research project: While I can\\u2019t share the code behind this project, I can walk through an example of building a fully-interactive Bokeh application using publicly available data. This series of articles will cover the entire process of creating an application using Bokeh. For this first post, we\\u2019ll cover the basic elements of Bokeh, which we\\u2019ll build upon in subsequent posts. Throughout this series, we\\u2019ll be working with the nycflights13 dataset, which has records of over 300,000 flights from 2013. We will first concentrate on visualizing a single variable, in this case the arrival delay of flights in minutes and we\\u2019ll start by constructing a basic histogram, a classic method for display the spread and location of one continuous variable. The full code is accessible on GitHub and the first Jupyter notebook can be found here. This post focuses on the visuals so I encourage anyone to check out the code if they want to see the unglamorous, but necessary steps of data cleaning and formatting! The major concept of Bokeh is that graphs are built up one layer at a time. We start out by creating a figure, and then we add elements, called glyphs, to the figure. (For those who have used ggplot, the idea of glyphs is essentially the same as that of geoms which are added to a graph one \\u2018layer\\u2019 at a time.) Glyphs can take on many shapes depending on the desired use: circles, lines, patches, bars, arcs, and so on. Let\\u2019s illustrate the idea of glyphs by making a basic chart with squares and circles. First, we make a plot using the figure method and then we append our glyphs to the plot by calling the appropriate method and passing in data. Finally, we show our plot (I\\u2019m using a Jupyter Notebook which lets you see the plots right below the code if you use the output_notebook call). This generates the slightly uninspiring plot below: While we could have easily made this chart in any plotting library, we get a few tools for free with any Bokeh plot which are on the right side and include panning, zooming, selection, and plot saving abilities. These tools are configurable and will come in handy when we want to investigate our data. Let\\u2019s now get to work on showing our flight delay data. Before we can jump right into the graph, we should load in the data and give it a brief inspection (bold is code output): The summary stats give us information to inform our plotting decisions: we have 327,346 flights, with a minimum delay of -86 minutes (meaning the flight was early by 86 minutes) and a maximum delay of 1272 minutes, an astounding 21 hours! The 75% quantile is only at 14 minutes, so we can assume that numbers over 1000 minutes are likely outliers (which does not mean they are illegitimate, just extreme). I will focus on delays between -60 minutes and +120 minutes for our histogram. A histogram is a common choice for an initial visualization of a single variable because it shows the distribution of the data. The x-position is the value of the variable grouped into intervals called bins, and the height of each bar represents the count (number) of data points in each interval. In our case, the x-position will represent the arrival delay in minutes and the height is the number of flights in the corresponding bin. Bokeh does not have a built-in histogram glyph, but we can make our own using the quad glyph which allows us to specify the bottom, top, left, and right edges of each bar. To create the data for the bars, we will use the numpy histogram function which calculates the number of data points in each specified bin. We will use bins of 5 minute length which means the function will count the number of flights in each five minute delay interval. After generating the data, we put it in a pandas dataframe to keep all the data in one object. The code here is not crucial for understanding Bokeh, but it\\u2019s useful nonetheless because of the prevalence of numpy and pandas in data science! Our data looks like this: The flightscolumn is the count of the number of flights within each delay interval from leftto right. From here, we can make a new Bokeh figure and add a quad glpyh specifying the appropriate parameters: Most of the work in producing this graph comes in the data formatting which is not an unusual occurrence in data science! From our plot, we see that arrival delays are nearly normally distributed with a slight positive skew or heavy tail on the right side. There are easier ways to create a basic histogram in Python, and the same result could be done using a few lines of matplotlib. However, the payoff in the development required for a Bokeh plot comes in the tools and ways to interact with the data that we can now easily add to the graph. The first type of interactivity we will cover in this series is passive interactions. These are actions the viewer can take which do not alter the data displayed. These are referred to as inspectors because they allow viewers to \\u201cinvestigate\\u201d the data in more detail . A useful inspector is the tooltip which appears when a user mouses over data points and is called the HoverTool in Bokeh. In order to add tooltips, we need to change our data source from a dataframe to a ColumnDataSource, a key concept in Bokeh. This is an object specifically used for plotting that includes data along with several methods and attributes. The ColumnDataSource allows us to add annotations and interactivity to our graphs, and can be constructed from a pandas dataframe. The actual data itself is held in a dictionary accessible through the data attribute of the ColumnDataSource. Here, we create the source from our dataframe and look at the keys of the data dictionary which correspond to the columns of our dataframe. When we add glyphs using a ColumnDataSource, we pass in the ColumnDataSource as the source parameter and refer to the column names using strings: Notice how the code refers to the specific data columns, such as \\u2018flights\\u2019, \\u2018left\\u2019, and \\u2018right\\u2019 by a single string instead of the df['column'] format as before. The syntax of a HoverTool may seem a little convoluted at first, but with practice they are quite easy to create. We pass our HoverToolinstance a list of tooltips as Python tuples where the first element is the label for the data and the second references the specific data we want to highlight. We can reference either attributes of the graph, such as x or y position using \\u2018$\\u2019 or specific fields in our source using \\u2018@\\u2019. That probably sounds a little confusing so here\\u2019s an example of a HoverTool where we do both: Here, we reference the left data field in the ColumnDataSource (which corresponds to the \\u2018left\\u2019 column of the original dataframe) using \\u2018@\\u2019 and we reference the (x,y) position of the cursor using \\u2018$\\u2019. The result is below: The (x,y) position is that of the mouse on the graph and is not very helpful for our histogram, because we to find the find the number of flights in a given bar which corresponds to the top of the bar. To fix that we will alter our tooltip instance to refer to the correct column. Formatting the data shown in a tooltip can be frustrating, so I usually create another column in my dataframe with the correct formatting. For example, if I want my tooltip to show the entire interval for a given bar, I create a formatted column in my dataframe: Then I convert this dataframe into a ColumnDataSource and access this column in my HoverTool call. The following code creates the plot with a hover tool referring to two formatted columns and adds the tool to the plot: In the Bokeh style, we include elements in our chart by adding them to the original figure. Notice in the p.quad glyph call, there are a few additional parameters, hover_fill_alpha and hover_fill_color, that change the look of the glyph when we mouse over the bar. I also added in styling using a style function (see the notebook for the code). Aesthetics are tedious to type, so I usually write a function that I can apply to any plot. When I use styling, I keep things simple and focus on readability of labels. The main point of a plot is to show the data, and adding unnecessary elements only detracts from the usefulness of a figure! The final plot is presented below: As we mouse over different bars, we get the precise statistics for that bar showing the interval and the number of flights within that interval. If we are proud of our plot, we can save it to an html file to share: It took me more than one plot to get the basic workflow of Bokeh so don\\u2019t worry if it seems there is a lot to learn. We\\u2019ll get plenty more practice over the course of this series! While it might seem like Bokeh is a lot of work, the benefits come when we want to extend our visuals beyond simple static figures. Once we have a basic chart, we can increase the effectiveness of the visual by adding more elements. For example, if we want to look at the arrival delay by airline, we can make an interactive chart allowing users to select and compare airlines. We will leave active interactions, those that change the data displayed, to the next post, but here\\u2019s a look at what we can do: Active interactions require a bit more involved scripting, but that gives us a chance to work on our Python! (If anyone wants to have a look at the code for this plot before the next article, here it is.) Throughout this series, I want to emphasize that Bokeh or any one library tool will never be a one stop tool for all your plotting needs. Bokeh is great for allowing users to explore graphs, but for other uses, like simple exploratory data analysis, a lightweight library such asmatplotliblikely will be more efficient. This series is meant to show the capabilities of Bokeh to give you another plotting tool you can rely on as needed. The more libraries you know, the better equipped you will be to use the right visualization tool for the task. As always, I welcome constructive criticism and feedback.

My effort to liberate data from spreadsheets Everyone \\u2014 corporations, governments, individuals \\u2014 has data, but few people know how to use it effectively. Data can tell us much about how to make better decisions, but often this knowledge is hidden within the numbers. One problem is that most of the data looks something like this: Although the information here, global CO2 emissions, is \\u201copen data\\u201d in the sense that it\\u2019s publicly available for anyone to download, it might as well be locked away for all the good it is doing anyone in a spreadsheet. At its core, data science is about taking these meaningless pages of numbers and turning them into useful knowledge. One of the most effective ways of revealing insights within numbers is through data visualization. For HackCWRU 2018, a hackathon hosted at Case Western Reserve University, I wanted to explore the public CO2 data and make it accessible to a general audience. For those who haven\\u2019t had the experience, a hackathon is where a bunch of passionate makers \\u2014 coders, artists, hardware specialists, and occasionally data scientists \\u2014 get together for a weekend to work on projects for 24 or 36 straight hours. Sometimes there are specific problems to solve, but in other cases, such as with HackCWRU, you are free to choose your team and project. With a limited amount of time to accomplish your goal, sleeping is generally discouraged! There were all sorts of projects done at HackCWRU: phone apps, virtual reality games, motion capture programs, and I choose to do what I enjoy the most: data visualization. I went solo, under the project name emissions explorer, sticking with my habit of adding explorer to all my projects (see the stock explorer and weight explorer). My objective for the weekend was to show how data visualization can take millions of numbers and turn them into meaningful knowledge by building an interactive data exploration website. The entire website is available online and the code is also freely available on GitHub for anyone to use or improve. (The website works best on desktop as I didn\\u2019t quite have time to make it mobile-responsive. That would be a great fix for anyone to implement!). I\\u2019ll present most of the results below as I go through my process, but I highly recommend anyone check out the website to get the full experience. Before we can get to the fun part of making visuals, we have to find and clean some data. In a normal data science workflow, this make take up to 90% of the time spent on a project. However, working on a limited time schedule, I needed clean data and fast. I pulled together data from three sources: GapMinder (curated by Tom Carden), the climate data online tool, and the World Bank, all in the familiar csv file format. The data was in good shape, but there were some inconsistencies, mostly to do with country names. I spent quite a bit of time figuring out that South Korea was coded as \\u2018Korea, Rep.\\u2019 and North Korea as \\u2018Korea, Dem. Rep.\\u2019 All the data formatting was done in Python (in Jupyter Notebooks), making use of Pandas and Numpy. Final versions of the data were saved as json (Javascript Object Notation), a machine readable data-interchange format. While normally I work with Python and R for analysis and visualization, part of data science is knowing the right tools to use for the job, and one of the best options for interactive plots is d3.js. D3, Data-Driven Documents is a JavaScript library that lets you control every aspect of a chart by building it up one element at a time. It has a very steep learning curve, but the end results are worth it! For my first chart, I wanted to do something with a map because I enjoy seeing comparisons between countries in a geographic context. My idea was to create a world map and place circles on countries sized proportional to the amount of CO2 they emitted. The color of the circles would reflect the country\\u2019s rank in terms of emissions. As CO2 emissions have changed considerably, especially in the past few decades, I included a time dimension with options to visualize the entire history of the data (1850\\u20132014) and a selection box so users can choose a specific year. The final results are presented in the following animation: As a finishing touch, I added tooltips showing the exact amount emitted by each country and the country\\u2019s ranking in the given year when you mouse over the country. It\\u2019s the little details like this that I love about professionally produced charts so I tried to do a little of that on my own! After finishing up the map, I wanted to make a better way to compare the top countries over time. There are a lot of details hidden in the map animation, and it\\u2019s not great for visualizing trajectories over time. The most common way to show time series is with simple line plots, and I saw no reason to invent a different solution. Again, I kept an interactive element in the chart by allowing users to select specific countries. The most difficult part of making this chart was the auto-scaling on the y-axis. Luckily, d3 lets you control every single aspect of a graph, so I was able to specify that the axis scale should update to match the country with the largest emissions. I thought this visual was better for comparing the top 15 countries than the map and playing around with it reveals a number of insights. For example, China surpasses the US in 2005 (not an area in which you want to be #1), and although the United Kingdom initially started out as the largest emitter, by 2014, their output pales in comparison to industrialized nations. One of the most influential data visualization inspirations to me is the late Hans Rosling, the founder of GapMinder. In particular, his talk showing the demographic changes in countries over time has stuck with me many years after I first watched it, in a way that no spreadsheet ever could. For a final visual, I wanted to try and recreate the GapMinder style of chart and use some additional socio-economic data in the process. Drawing heavily on Mike Bostock\\u2019s The Wealth and Health of Nations Chart, I made my own take on the animated, interactive visual. There were four different variables to represent on the same graph, which I broke up into the following The final version takes some time to absorb because it presents quite a bit of information! This chart also allows users to change the year by mousing over the label. When I was showcasing this, I had a number of people compare this to Hans Rosling\\u2019s work, which might be the highest data visualization complement I\\u2019ve gotten! Once I had all the charts together, I put together a quick home page and about page by copying and pasting existing html/css templates. I then hosted my files and created a static website on Amazon S3, a cloud storage service. (This tutorial was helpful). My formal mechanical engineering/data science education did not include any instruction in web design, so the overall aesthetic clearly needs some work. Nonetheless, the three charts accomplish the goal I set out to achieve: liberate this valuable public data from spreadsheets where it is not benefitting anyone! One element I made sure to include in all the charts was interactivity. When I look at charts, I enjoy playing with the data myself and changing the parameters to find all the nuances. As this was an exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, I wanted to let users come to some conclusions on their own. While the overall message is that CO2 emissions have undoubtedly been increasing over time, there are other interesting takeaways in the charts that people can find on their own. We think of data as containing objective truth, but even with numbers, different individuals will bring their own interpretations that affect the knowledge they derive from the data. There are certainly times when we want to use data to prove a point, such as with medical trials, but in the case of this public data, I wanted to make it more accessible for people to use as they see fit. Although I did end up winning two prizes \\u2014 the civic track and best use of Amazon Web Services \\u2014 the swag isn\\u2019t as important as working on a cool project. Furthermore, the hackathon challenged me to learn another skill, d3.js, that I can add to the toolbox I use for data science. Successful data scientists are always willing to learn and there is no stage at which you have mastered everything. D3.js might not be worth the steep learning curve \\u2014 plot.ly can be used in Python and is built on d3, and Tableau allows you to make professional charts from clean data very quickly \\u2014 but I enjoyed the project nonetheless. Hackathons are a great way to get a lot of experience on real problems and I recommend them to anyone who loves to solve problems/ create unique projects. While I choose to take a data science approach, hackathons welcome people from all backgrounds, and I encourage anyone to try one out!

Using Bayesian Inference on a real-world problem The fundamental idea of Bayesian inference is to become \\u201cless wrong\\u201d with more data. The process is straightforward: we have an initial belief, known as a prior, which we update as we gain additional information. Although we don\\u2019t think about it as Bayesian Inference, we use this technique all the time. For example, we might initially think there is a 50% chance we will get a promotion at the end of the quarter. If we receive positive feedback from our manager, we adjust our estimate upwards, and conversely, we might decrease the probability if we make a mess with the coffee machine. As we continually gather information, we refine our estimate to get closer to the \\u201ctrue\\u201d answer. Our intuitive actions are formalized in the simple yet powerful equation known as Bayes\\u2019 Rule: We read the left side, called the posterior, as the conditional probability of event A given event B. On the right side, P(A) is our prior, or the initial belief of the probability of event A, P(B|A) is the likelihood (also a conditional probability), which we derive from our data, and P(B) is a normalization constant to make the probability distribution sum to 1. The general form of Bayes\\u2019 Rule in statistical language is the posterior probability equals the likelihood times the prior divided by the normalization constant. This short equation leads to the entire field of Bayesian Inference, an effective method for reasoning about the world. While A\\u2019s and B\\u2019s may be good placeholders, they aren\\u2019t very helpful for letting us see how we can use this concept. To do that, we can apply Bayes\\u2019 Rule to a problem with real world data. One problem I have been exploring in my own life is sleeping patterns. I have more than 2 months of data from my Garmin Vivosmart watch showing when I fall asleep and wake up. In a previous post, I figured out the probability I am asleep at a given time using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.The final model showing the most likely distribution of sleep as a function of time (MCMC is an approximate method) is below. This is the probability I am asleep taking into account only the time. What if we know the time and have additional evidence? How would knowing that my bedroom light is on change the probability that I am asleep? This is where we use Bayes\\u2019 Rule to update our estimate. For a specific time, if we know information about my bedroom light, we can use the probability from the distribution above as the prior and then apply Bayes\\u2019 equation: The left side is the posterior, the conditional probability of sleep given the status of my bedroom light (either on or off). The probability at a given time will serve as our prior, P(sleep) , or the estimate we use if we have no additional information. For example, at 10:00 PM, the prior probability I am asleep is 27.34%. If we do have more information, we can update this using the likelihood, P(bedroom light |sleep) , which is derived from observed data. Based on my habits, I know the probability my bedroom light is on given that I am asleep is about 1%. That is: The probability that my light is off given I am asleep is 1\\u20130.01 = 0.99(Here I am using the minus sign (-) to indicate the opposite condition.) This is because conditional probability distributions must sum to 1. If we know I am asleep, either my bedroom light has to be on or it has to be off! The final piece of the equation is the normalization constant P(light) . This represents the total probability my light is on. There are two conditions for which my light is on: I am asleep or I am awake. Therefore, if we know the prior probability of sleep, we can calculate the normalization constant as: The total probability my light is on takes into account both the chance I am asleep and my light is on and the chance I am awake and my light is on. (P(-sleep) = 1 \\u2014 P(sleep) is the probability I am awake.) The probability my light is on given that I am not asleep, P(light | \\u2014 sleep), is also determined from observations. In my case, I know there is around a 80% probability my bedroom light is on if I am awake (which means there is a 20% chance my light is not on if I\\u2019m awake). Using the total probability for my light being on, Bayes\\u2019 equation is: This represents the probability I am asleep given that my light is on. If my light is off, then we replace every P(light|... with P(-light|.... That\\u2019s more than enough equations with only words, let\\u2019s see how we can use this with numbers! We will walk through applying the equation for a time of 10:30 PM if we know my light is on. First, we calculate the prior probability I am asleep using the time and get an answer of 73.90%. The prior provides a good starting point for our estimate, but we can improve it by incorporating info about my light. Knowing that my light is on, we can fill in Bayes\\u2019 Equation with the relevant numbers: The knowledge that my light is on drastically changes our estimate of the probability I am asleep from over 70% to 3.42%. This shows the power of Bayes\\u2019 Rule: we were able to update our initial estimate for the situation by incorporating more information. While we might have intuitively done this anyway, thinking about it in terms of formal equations allows us to update our beliefs in a rigorous manner. Let\\u2019s try another example. What if it is 9:45 PM, and my light is off? Try to work this one out starting with the prior probability of 0.1206. Instead of always doing this inference by hand, I wrote some simple Python code to do these calculations which you can play with in the Jupyter Notebook. The code outputs the following answer: We again see the extra information changes our estimate. Now, if my sister wants to call me at 9:45 PM and she somehow knows that my light is on, she can consult this equation to determine if I will pick up (assuming I always pick up when I\\u2019m awake)! Who says you can\\u2019t use stats in your daily life? Seeing the numerical results is helpful, but visualizations can also be useful for making the point clearer. I always try to incorporate plots to communicate ideas if they don\\u2019t come across just by looking at equations. Here, we can visualize the prior and the conditional probability distribution of sleep using the extra data. When my light is on, the curve is shifted to the right, indicating there is a lower probability I am asleep at a given time. Likewise, the curve is shifted to the left if my light is off. It can be difficult to conceptually understand a statistical concept, but this illustration demonstrates precisely why we use Bayes\\u2019 Rule. If we want to be less wrong about the world, then additional information should change our beliefs, and Bayesian Inference updates our estimates using a systematic method. Why stop with my bedroom light? We can use as much information in the model as we like and it will continue to get more precise (as long as the data tells us something useful about the situation). For example, if I know the likelihood my phone is charging given that I am asleep is 95%, we can incorporate that knowledge into the model. Here, we will assume the probability my phone is charging is conditionally independent of the probability my light is on given the information of whether or not I am sleeping (independence is a little more advanced concept, but it allows us to simplify many problems). Bayes\\u2019 equation using the extra information is expressed: That might look intimidating, but using a little Python code, we can make a function to do the calculation for us. We feed in any time, and any combination of whether or not my light is on and phone is charging and the function returns the updated probability I am asleep. I\\u2019ll skip the math (I let my computer do it anyway) and show the results: At 11:00 PM, with no additional information, we would guess with almost certainty that I am asleep. However, once we have the additional information that my light is on and phone is not charging, we conclude there is only a miniscule chance I am asleep. Here\\u2019s another query: The probability shifts lower or higher depending on the exact situation. To demonstrate this, we can look at the four configurations of light and phone evidence and how they change the probability distribution: There is a lot of information in this graph, but the critical idea is that the probability curve changes depending on the evidence. As we get more data, we can further refine our estimate. Bayes\\u2019 Rule and other statistical concepts can be difficult to understand when presented with abstract equations using only letters or made-up situations. I\\u2019ve been through many classes where Bayes Rule was shown in terms of not very useful examples like coin flips or drawing colored balls from an urn, but it wasn\\u2019t until this project that I finally understood the applicability of Bayesian inference. If you\\u2019re struggling with a concept, seek out a situation where you can apply it, or look at cases where others have already done so! Actual learning comes when we translate concepts to problems. Not only can we learn new skills this way, but we can also do some pretty cool projects! Success in data science is about continuously learning, adding new techniques to your skillset, and figuring out the best method for different tasks. Here we showed how Bayesian Inference lets us update our beliefs to account for new evidence in order to better model reality. We constantly need to adjust our predictions as we gather more evidence, and Bayes\\u2019 Equation provides us with the appropriate framework. As always, I welcome feedback, discussion, and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. How to avoid being fooled by randomness The CEO of a major drug company has a problem. The new miracle drug developed by his chemists to do increase willpower has failed in every trial. The CEO cannot believe these results, but the researchers tell him there is no evidence of an effect on willpower at a significance level (p-value) of 0.05. Convinced the drug must be beneficial in some way, the CEO has a brilliant idea: instead of testing the drug for just one effect, test it for 1000 different effects at the same time, all at the same p-value. Even if it doesn\\u2019t increase willpower, it must do something, like reduce anxiety or boost memory. Skeptical, the researchers redo the trials exactly as the CEO says, monitoring 1000 different health measures of subjects on the drug. The researchers come back with astounding news: the drug had a significant effect on 50 of the measured values! Miraculous right? Actually, it would be more surprising if they had found no significant effects with this experimental analysis. The CEO\\u2019s mistake is an example of the multiple comparisons problem. The issue comes down to the noisiness of data in the real world. While the chance of noise affecting one result may be small, the more measurements we make, the larger the probability that a random fluctuation is mis-classified as a meaningful result. While this affects researchers performing objective studies, it can also be used for nefarious purposes. The CEO has a drug that he wants to sell but it doesn\\u2019t do what it was designed for. Instead of admitting failure, he instructs his researchers to keep looking until they find some vital sign the drug improves. Even if the drug has absolutely no effect on any health markers, the researchers will eventually find it does improve some measures because of random noise in the data. For this reason, the multiple comparisons problem is also called the look-elsewhere effect: if a researcher doesn\\u2019t find the result she wants, she can just keep looking until she finds some beneficial effect! Fortunately, most statisticians and researchers are honest and use methods to account for the multiple comparisons problem. The most common technique is called the Bonferroni Correction, but before we can explain it, we need to talk about p-values. The p-value represents the probability that in a world where the null hypothesis is true, the test statistic would be at least as extreme as the measured value. In the drug example, for the initial trial, the null hypothesis is that the drug does not increase the average motivation of individuals. The alternative hypothesis, or the researcher\\u2019s belief, is the drug increases average motivation. With a p-value of 0.05, this means in a world where the drug does not increase average motivation, the researchers would measure the drug does increase motivation 5% of the time due to random noise. Before a study is run, researchers select a p-value (known as alpha or the significance level) for establishing statistical significance. If the measured p-value falls below the the threshold, the null hypothesis is rejected and the results are statistically significant. A lower measured p-value is considered better because it shows the results are less likely to occur by chance. Once we know what a p-value represents, we can spot the CEO\\u2019s mistake. He ordered the trial to be run again with the same p-value of 0.05, but instead of testing for just one effect, he wanted to test for 1000. If we perform 1000 hypothesis tests with a p-value of 0.05, we would expect on average to find 50 significant results due to random noise (5% of 1000). Some of the results might actually be meaningful, but it would be unethical to declare they all are and sell the drug based on this study! The figure below illustrates the issue. I generated 1000 random numbers from a standard normal distribution and plotted them on the corresponding probability density function. We can ignore the y-axis here and focus on the x-axis which is in terms of the z-score. If we perform a hypothesis test and assume the mean of our test statistic (measured value) comes from a normal distribution, then we calculate our test-statistic in terms of a z-score. Using our selected p-value (alpha) for the hypothesis test, we can then find the z-score needed for statistical significance. These thresholds for a p-value of 0.05 are shown as the red vertical lines, with observations outside the lines considered to be statistically significant. The black dots are insignificant randomly generated observations, while the red dots are \\u201csignificant\\u201d randomly generated data points. We can see with random observations and using an uncorrected p-value, we classify a number of these results as significant! This might be great news if we have a drug to sell, but as responsible data scientists, we need to account for performing multiple tests so we are not misled by noise. A simple fix to the multiple comparisons problem is the Bonferroni Correction. To compensate for many hypothesis tests, we take the p-value for a single comparison and divide it by the number of tests. In the case of the drug company trial, the original p-value of 0.05 should be divided by 1000, resulting in a new significance threshold of 0.00005. This means results must be more extreme for them to be considered significant, decreasing the probability that random noise is characterized as meaningful. We can apply the Bonferroni Correction to the graph made above and see how it affects the classification of random points. The graph has the same structure, but now the significance thresholds account for multiple tests. No random data points are now considered significant! There are criticisms that the Bonferroni Correction is too conservative and it may lead us to reject some results which actually are meaningful. However, the important concept behind the method is the significance value needs to be adjusted when we make many comparisons. The problem of multiple comparisons extends to more than just hypothesis tests. If we compare enough data sets, we can find correlations that are nothing more than random noise. This is humorously illustrated by the website Spurious Correlations which has examples of completely unrelated trends that happen to closely follow each other. The multiple comparisons issue is important to keep in mind when we examine studies, but it can also be used in our daily lives. If we look hard enough, we can find correlations anywhere, but that does not mean we should make lifestyle changes because of them. Maybe we weigh ourselves every day and find our weight is negatively correlated with the number of text messages we send. It would be foolish to send more text messages in the hopes of losing weight. Humans are adept at spotting patterns, and when we look hard enough and make enough comparisons, we can convince ourselves there is meaning in random noise. Once we are aware of this tendency, we are prepared to analyze dubious claims and make rational choices. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

As the dean at a major university, you receive a concerning report showing your students get an average of 6.80 hours of sleep per night compared to the national college average of 7.02 hours. The student body president is worried about the health of students and points to this study as proof that homework must be reduced. The university president on the other hand dismisses the study as nonsense: \\u201cBack in my day we got four hours of sleep a night and considered ourselves lucky.\\u201d You have to decide if this is a serious issue. Fortunately, you\\u2019re well-versed in statistics and finally see a chance to put your education to use! Statistical significance is one of those terms we often hear without really understanding. When someone claims data proves their point, we nod and accept it, assuming statisticians have done complex operations that yielded a result which cannot be questioned. In fact, statistical significance is not a complicated phenomenon requiring years of study to master, but a straightforward idea that everyone can \\u2014 and should \\u2014 understand. Like with most technical concepts, statistical significance is built on a few simple ideas: hypothesis testing, the normal distribution, and p values. In this article, we will briefly touch on all of these concepts (with further resources provided) as we work up to solving the conundrum presented above. Author\\u2019s Note: An earlier edition of this post oversimplified the definition of the p-value. I would like to thank\\nProfessor Timothy Bates\\nfor correcting my mistake. This was a great example of the type of collaborative learning possible online and I encourage any feedback, corrections, or discussion! The first idea we have to discuss is hypothesis testing, a technique for evaluating a theory using data. The \\u201chypothesis\\u201d refers to the researcher\\u2019s initial belief about the situation before the study. This initial theory is known as the alternative hypothesis and the opposite is known as the null hypothesis. In our example these are: Notice how careful we have to be about the wording: we are looking for a very specific effect, which needs to be formalized in the hypotheses so after the fact we cannot claim to have been testing something else! (This is an example of a one-sided hypothesis test because we are concerned with a change in only one direction.) Hypothesis tests are one of the foundations of statistics and are used to assess the results of most studies. These studies can be anything from a medical trial to assess drug effectiveness to an observational study evaluating an exercise plan. What all studies have in common is that they are concerned with making comparisons, either between two groups or between one group and the entire population. In the medical example, we might compare the average time to recover between groups taking two different drugs, or, in our problem as dean, we want to compare sleep between our students and all the students in the country. The testing part of hypothesis tests allows us to determine which theory, the null or alternative, is better supported by the evidence. There are many hypothesis tests and we will use one called the z-test. However, before we can get to testing our data, we need to talk about two more crucial ideas. The second building block of statistical significance is the normal distribution, also called the Gaussian or bell curve. The normal distribution is used to represent how data from a process is distributed and is defined by the mean, given the Greek letter \\u03bc (mu), and the standard deviation, given the letter \\u03c3 (sigma). The mean shows the location of the center of the data and the standard deviation is the spread in the data. The application of the normal distribution comes from assessing data points in terms of the standard deviation. We can determine how anomalous a data point is based on how many standard deviations it is from the mean. The normal distribution has the following helpful properties: If we have a normal distribution for a statistic, we can characterize any point in terms of standard deviations from the mean. For example, average female height in the US is 65 inches (5' 5\\\") with a standard deviation of 4 inches. If we meet a new acquaintance who is 73 inches tall, we can say she is two standard deviations above the mean and is in the tallest 2.5% of females. (2.5% of females will be shorter than \\u03bc \\u2014 2\\u03c3 (57 in) and 2.5% will be taller than \\u03bc+2\\u03c3). In statistics, instead of saying our data is two standard deviations from the mean, we assess it in terms of a z-score, which just represents the number of standard deviations a point is from the mean. Conversion to a z-score is done by subtracting the mean of the distribution from the data point and dividing by the standard deviation. In the height example, you can check that our friend would have a z-score of 2. If we do this to all the data points the new distribution is called the standard normal with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1 as shown below. Every time we do a hypothesis test, we need to assume a distribution for the test statistic, which in our case is the average (mean) hours of sleep for our students. For a z-test, the normal curve is used as an approximation for the distribution of the test statistic. Generally, according to the central limit theorem, as we take more averages from a data distribution, the averages will tend towards a normal distribution. However, this will always be an estimate because real-world data never perfectly follows a normal distribution. Assuming a normal distribution lets us determine how meaningful the result we observe in a study is. The higher or lower the z-score, the more unlikely the result is to happen by chance and the more likely the result is meaningful. To quantify just how meaningful the results are, we use one more concept. The final core idea is that of p-values. A p-value is the probability of observing results at least as extreme as those measured when the null hypothesis is true. That might seem a little convoluted, so let\\u2019s look at an example. Say we are measuring average IQ in the US states of Florida and Washington. Our null hypothesis is that average IQs in Washington are not higher than average IQs in Florida. We perform the study and find IQs in Washington are higher by 2.2 points with a p-value of 0.346. This means, in a world where the null hypothesis \\u2014 average IQs in Washington are not higher than average IQs in Florida \\u2014 is true, there is a 34.6% chance we would measure IQs at least 2.2 points higher in Washington. So, if IQs in Washington are not actually higher, we would still measure they are higher by at least 2.2 points about 1/3 of the time due to random noise. Subsequently, the lower the p-value, the more meaningful the result because it is less likely to be caused by noise. Whether or not the result can be called statistically significant depends on the p-value (known as alpha) we establish for significance before we begin the experiment . If the observed p-value is less than alpha, then the results are statistically significant. We need to choose alpha before the experiment because if we waited until after, we could just select a number that proves our results are significant no matter what the data shows! The choice of alpha depends on the situation and the field of study, but the most commonly used value is 0.05, corresponding to a 5% chance the results occurred at random. In my lab, I see values from 0.1 to 0.001 commonly in use. As an extreme example, the physicists who discovered the Higgs Boson particle used a p-value of 0.0000003, or a 1 in 3.5 million chance the discovery occurred because of noise. (Statisticians are loathe to admit that a p-value of 0.05 is arbitrary. R.A. Fischer, the father of modern statistics, choose a p-value of 0.05 for indeterminate reasons and it stuck)! To get from a z-score on the normal distribution to a p-value, we can use a table or statistical software like R. The result will show us the probability of a z-score lower than the calculated value. For example, with a z-score of 2, the p-value is 0.977, which means there is only a 2.3% probability we observe a z-score higher than 2 at random. As a summary so far, we have covered three ideas: Now, let\\u2019s put the pieces together in our example. Here are the basics: First, we need to convert our measurement into a z-score, or the number of standard deviations it is away from the mean. We do this by subtracting the population mean (the national average) from our measured value and dividing by the standard deviation over the square root of the number of samples. (As the number of samples increases, the standard deviation and hence the variation decreases. We account for this by dividing the standard deviation by the square root of the number of samples.) The z-score is called our test-statistic. Once we have a test-statistic, we can use a table or a programming language such as R to calculate the p-value. I use code here not to intimidate but to show how easy it is to implement our solution with free tools! (# are comments and bold is output) Based on the p-value of 0.02116, we can reject the null hypothesis. (Statisticians like us to say reject the null rather than accept the alternative.) There is statistically significant evidence our students get less sleep on average than college students in the US at a significance level of 0.05. The p-value shows there is a 2.12% chance that our results occurred because of random noise. In this battle of the presidents, the student was right. Before we ban all homework, we need to be careful not to assign too much to this result. Notice that our p-value, 0.02116, would not be significant if we had used a threshold of 0.01. Someone who wants to prove the opposite point in our study can simply manipulate the p-value. Anytime we examine a study, we should think about the p-value and the sample size in addition to the conclusion. With a relatively small sample size of 202, our study might have statistical significance, but that does mean it is practically meaningful. Further, this was an observational study, which means there is only evidence for correlation and not causation. We showed there is a correlation between students at our school and less average sleep, but not that going to our school causes a decrease in sleep. There could be other factors at play that affect sleep and only a randomized controlled study is able to prove causation. As with most technical concepts, statistical significance is not that complex and is just a combination of many small ideas. Most of the trouble comes with learning the vocabulary! Once you put the pieces together, you can start applying these statistical concepts. As you learn the basics of stats, you become better prepared to view studies and the news with a healthy skepticism. You can see what the data actually says rather than what someone tells you it means. The best tactic against dishonest politicians and corporations is a skeptical, well-educated public!

Why trying to avoid spreadsheets is the best way to learn data science The best way to learn a new skill is using it to solve problems. In my previous life as an aerospace engineering student, I spent hours writing complicated formulas in Excel to do everything from designing wings to calculating reentry angles of spacecraft. After hours of labor, I would present results in the bland Excel charts that dominate so many powerpoints. Convinced this was not an optimal workflow, I decided to learn Python, a common coding language, solely to avoid spending all my waking hours in Excel. With the help of Automate the Boring Stuff with Python by Al Sweigart, I picked up enough of the language to cut the time I spent in Excel by 90%. Rather than memorizing the basics, I focused on efficiently solving aerospace problems. I was soon flying through assignments, and when I presented Python graphs in class, I was asked what sort of magic techniques I used. Without even trying, I gained a reputation as someone who could take a tangled spreadsheet and turn the data into illuminating images. Ironically, it was only when I had reached the top of my field that I decided to make the switch to data science. While working as an aerospace engineer intern at NASA, I was surrounded by some of the brightest people in the country. However, these individuals\\u2019 brilliance was severely constrained because they ended up spending most of their time poring over that curse of modern data: Excel spreadsheets. These were people working on expanding humanity\\u2019s knowledge of the universe literally doing rocket science in spreadsheets! It was at this moment that I realized I would have a greater impact as a data scientist helping people make sense from data than as an aerospace engineer. Although I was working on a mission to send a satellite into space (Near-Earth Asteroid Scout), I was frustrated with the work because it mostly involved hours of paging through numbers. Often, these spreadsheets had been used for years and people trusted the numbers despite not being able to understand the formulas. I eventually gave up trying to comprehend the spreadsheets and instead set about automating calculations using the little bit of Python I knew. Building on my limited knowledge I had from trying to escape spreadsheets in school, and using some code I copied and pasted from Stack Overflow, I was able to increase my work efficiency and quality. Tentatively, I mentioned to colleagues there was a better way to do their work. Although they were skeptical, they had seen my results, and were willing to listen. After showing them a few examples where I wrote simple code to replace editing spreadsheets by hand, they began to embrace the idea. At first, I wrote the scripts for them, a task I was happy to take on because my workload had been greatly reduced by a few lines of code, but eventually they were able to start writing their own scripts. (Although I did convince them to write code, it was almost always in Matlab or even Fortran. There are some things you just can\\u2019t change!) Over the course of a few weeks, I was transformed from a lowly intern into the go-to data consultant for my branch. This real-world application illustrates two critical points: Contrary to the traditional model of education, we first develop applications and then form theories, not the other way round. The internal combustion engine, one of the most influential technologies in history, came out of decades of tinkering by engineers not from theoreticians. Only after the engine had been invented did the theories underlying how it worked fall into place. I learned programming and data science not by memorizing the details of data structures and formulas, but by writing code to solve problems. Along the way, I picked up plenty of the basic knowledge I could have read in books. Now when I learn a new machine learning method, I go straight to using it on real data instead of studying the formulas. I get a better understanding of how a model works by seeing it in action instead of on the page. People usually think they need to be experts in a field before they can contribute. This prevents them from even starting to learn a new technique because they imagine it will be years before it will be useful. My experience with NASA provides a counterexample to this misconception. A limited amount of the correct knowledge, in this case data science, can be extremely influential. Rather than waiting until I knew everything possible about coding, I applied what I did know with beneficial results. The clich\\u00e9 that Rome was not built in a day implies large projects require years of work. However, there is a more important message here: an entire city does not need to be built before it is useful. Even with a few homes, a city still serves a purpose. Half of Rome is better than no Rome, just as some knowledge is preferable to no knowledge. Every new house built or every additional piece of knowledge inspires more growth in a positive feedback cycle. The key is to keep solving problems during the learning process instead of waiting until you master a subject to use it! These ideas should be encouraging to anyone wanting to pick up a new skill or switch fields. If you think it will take too long to learn a technique, or you are bored by the basics, don\\u2019t worry! The simple stuff is tedious and you\\u2019re better off learning by working on problems and picking up the fundamentals along the way. Furthermore, realize you can start getting useful results with a limited amount of the right knowledge. Solve a few basic problems and improve your skills as required when the complexity increases. Since we already used one clich\\u00e9, here\\u2019s another: \\u201cThe best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago. The second best time is today.\\u201d Don\\u2019t regret not learning programming \\u2014 or any skill \\u2014 while in school, but think about what you want to know in the future! Figure out the problems you (or your colleagues) need to solve and start learning. Looking back at it now, my road to data science was not smoothly planned, but evolved by solving problems and steadily acquiring tools. There has never been a better age to teach yourself anything, and the best way to expand your skill-set is to start working on problems! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

An example-based framework of a core data science concept Say you want to learn English. You have no prior knowledge of the language but you\\u2019ve heard the greatest English writer is William Shakespeare. A natural course of action surely must be locking yourself in a library and memorizing his works. After a year of study, you emerge from your studies, travel to New York City, and greet the first person you see with \\u201cGood dawning to thee, friend!\\u201d In response, you get a look of disdain and a muttered \\u2018crazy\\u2019. Unperturbed, you try again: \\u201cDear gentlewoman, How fares our gracious lady?\\u201d Another failure and a hurried retreat. After a third unsuccessful attempt, you are distraught: \\u201cWhat shame what sorrow!\\u201d. Shame indeed: you have just committed one of the most basic mistakes in modeling, overfitting on the training data. In data science courses, an overfit model is explained as having high variance and low bias on the training set which leads to poor generalization on new testing data. Let\\u2019s break that perplexing definition down in terms of our attempt to learn English. The model we want build is a representation of how to communicate using the English language. Our training data is the entire works of Shakespeare and our testing set is New York. If we measure performance in terms of social acceptance, then our model fails to generalize, or translate, to the testing data. That seems straightforward so far, but what about variance and bias? Variance is how much a model changes in response to the training data. As we are simply memorizing the training set, our model has high variance: it is highly dependent on the training data. If we read the entire works of J.K. Rowling rather than Shakespeare, the model will be completely different. When a model with high variance is applied on a new testing set, it cannot perform well because all it is lost without the training data. It\\u2019s like a student that has memorized the problems in the textbook, only to be helpless when faced with real world faced problems. Bias is the flip side of variance as it represents the strength of our assumptions we make about our data. In our attempt to learn English, we formed no initial model hypotheses and trusted the Bard\\u2019s work to teach us everything about the language. This low bias may seem like a positive\\u2014 why would we ever want to be biased towards our data? However, we should always be skeptical of data\\u2019s ability to tell us the complete story. Any natural process generates noise, and we cannot be confident our training data captures all of that noise. Often, we should make some initial assumptions about our data and leave room in our model for fluctuations not seen on the training data. Before we started reading, we should have decided that Shakespeare\\u2019s works could not literally teach us English on their own which would have led us to be cautious of memorizing the training data. To summarize so far: bias refers to how much we ignore the data, and variance refers to how dependent our model is on the data. In any modeling, there will always be a tradeoff between bias and variance and when we build models, we try to achieve the best balance. Bias vs variance is applicable to any model, from the simplest to the most complex and is a critical concept to understand for data scientists! We saw that a model that overfits has high variance and low bias. What about the reverse: low variance and high bias? This is known as underfitting: instead of following the training data too closely, a model that underfits the ignores the lessons from the training data and fails to learn the underlying relationship between inputs and outputs. Let\\u2019s think about this in terms of our example. Learning from our previous attempt to build a model of English, we decide to make a few assumptions about the model ahead of time. We also switch our training data and watch all episodes of the show Friends to teach ourselves English. To avoid repeating our mistakes from the first try, we make an assumption ahead of time that only sentences starting with the most common words in the language \\u2014 the, be, to, of, and, a \\u2014 are important. When we study, we do not pay attention to other sentences, confident we will build a better model. After a long period of training, we again journey out onto the streets of New York. This time we fare slightly better, but again, our conversations go nowhere and we are forced to admit defeat. While we know some English and can comprehend a limited number of sentences, we failed to learn the fundamental structure of the language due to our bias about the training data. The model does not suffer from high variance but we overcorrected from our initial attempt and underfit! What can we do? We paid strict attention to the data and we overfit. We ignored the data and we underfit. There has to be a way to find the optimal balance! Fortunately, there is a well-established solution in data science called validation. In our example, we used only a training set and a testing set. This meant we could not know ahead of time how our model would do in the real world. Ideally, we would have a \\u201cpre-test\\u201d set to evaluate our model and make improvements before the real test. This \\u201cpre-test\\u201d is known as a validation set and is a critical part of model development. Our two failures to learn English have made us much wiser and we now decide to use a validation set. We use both Shakespeare\\u2019s work and the Friends show because we have learned more data almost always improves a model. The difference this time is that after training and before we hit the streets, we evaluate our model on a group of friends that get together every week to discuss current events in English. The first week, we are nearly kicked out of the conversation because our model of the language is so bad. However, this is only the validation set, and each time we make mistakes we are able to adjust our model. Eventually, we can hold our own in conversation with the group and declare we are ready for the testing set. Venturing out in the real world once more, we are finally successful! Our model is now well suited for communication because we have a crucial element, a validation set for model development and optimization. This example is necessarily simplified. In data science models, we use numerous validation sets because otherwise we end up overfitting to the validation set! This is addressed by means of cross-validation, where we split the training data into different subsets, or we can use multiple validation sets if we have lots of data. This conceptual example stills covers all aspects of the problem. Now when you hear about overfitting vs. underfitting and bias vs. variance, you have a conceptual framework to understand the problem and how to fix it! Data science may seem complex but it is really built out of a series of basic building blocks. A few of those covered in this article are: Data science and other technical fields should not be divorced from our everyday lives. By explaining concepts with real-world examples, we can put them into context. If we understand the framework, then we can fill in the details by using the techniques on problems. The next post will provide an example using graphs and metrics, so if you want a more solid backing, check it out. Until then, fare you well dear readers! I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. I would like to thank Taylor Koehrsen (PharmD by the way) for helping me to sound less like an engineer in my writing! Why I\\u2019m ditching the library to write a data science blog Traditional education is simple: sit down, shut up, and listen to the teacher. After class, go to the library to repeatedly read the same words, trying to figure out abstract topics with little meaning in our daily lives. Even as a graduate student, I still am routinely lectured at and expected to spend large portions of time outside of class alone in contemplating my studies. While this might work fine for subjects that require simple regurgitation of information on a test \\u2014 looking at you history \\u2014 it is entirely unsuited for modern technical topics such as data science. With that in mind, here\\u2019s a radical proposal: rather than hitting the books when you want to understand a concept, you should hit your blog and try to explain it clearly to others. The idea is simple: if you can\\u2019t teach a topic to someone else, then you truly don\\u2019t get it yourself. When I began grad classes, I decided to take a new approach to education. Instead of sitting passively in class, I aimed to ask at least one question every lecture. This small adjustment had a profound impact on my engagement in class. I focused my questions on how to implement concepts we covered which often were presented without any practical examples. This active participation made it easier to concentrate in class and to apply topics to problems both in my research and on assignments. Outside of class, I spent less time studying alone and more time in the lab implementing data science techniques. I also made an effort to engage in conversations with other students about what we covered in class. In the process, I was trying to understand the topics not by memorization, but by explaining them to others. Informed by these discussions, my colleagues and I would try to use the techniques on our problems. Whether we failed or succeeded, we would come back for more debates, creating a productive feedback loop. Fortunately, I am in a lab with students and professors smarter than myself \\u2014 it\\u2019s a good idea to never be the smartest person in the room \\u2014 and every day I learn something new through seeing it done in practice. With even more data science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) grad classes this semester, I need to step up my sharing game. My goal is to write at least one blog post explaining a topic covered in class each week. I don\\u2019t have as much time to develop cool side applications such as the stock exploration or weight tracker Python tools, but I can take the time normally spent reviewing class material and instead write about what I have learned. This serves both to test if I actually understand the material and to benefit others! Communities are best served when information \\u2014 at least non-harmful info\\u2014 is freely shared. Some people think because they worked hard to learn what they know, others must do the same and they refuse to divulge anything that would make learning easier for others. I ardently disagree with this view: just because we pay tens of thousands of dollars for an education does not mean we should keep it to ourselves. Instead, I believe in the democratization of education and in helping others to learn from my (many) mistakes and (limited but growing) experience. In technical fields, particularly data science, the internet has expanded access to information, and it is now possible for anyone to learn and practice cutting edge techniques. Formal institutions no longer have a monopoly on knowledge, and I want to play a small part in lowering the barriers to these exciting new fields. Trying to explain concepts helps us understand them better ourselves. It takes genuine understanding and not memorization to translate a topic for a general audience. We have all experienced the situation where we exhaustively study a topic and think we completely understand the idea, only to completely blank when we have to apply it in a basic situation. Moreover, the most successful individuals in a field tend to not be the smartest, but those who can best communicate findings and show how they are relevant. Neil deGrasse Tyson is the best-known physicist in the world, not because he publishes the most brilliant papers, but because he translates tough concepts for a wide audience. Clear written and spoken communication skills are a major advantage that cannot be taught in a classroom! These once a week posts will usually be about data science and machine learning with a focus on real-world examples and metaphors. A good indicator of my aim is this correlation vs causation post. While metaphors can oversimplify concepts, my intent is to provide a high-level framework for learning these concepts. It\\u2019s useful to have the basic ideas down before diving into the details. The specifics can be filled in by applying them to solve problems (or maybe in a book if you prefer that route). If you can\\u2019t wait for my posts, I suggest checking out the data skeptic podcast, which does a great job of distilling data science topics for a general audience. Better yet, start your own blog! Writing is the best form of thinking out your ideas and sharing knowledge benefits everyone in the community. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter at @koehrsen_will. Viewing real world statistics skeptically It\\u2019s surprising the insights waiting to be discovered deep within the mass of emails we all receive. While mindlessly browsing my inbox, I briefly scanned a message from my University\\u2019s Study Abroad office with the following info about the benefits of studying overseas: What immediately caught my eye was those figures in the 90s \\u2014 clearly, studying abroad makes you irresistible to grad schools and employers. I was surprised at just how large the academic and career benefits were that came as a result of studying in another country. My second thought was: it\\u2019s too bad I didn\\u2019t choose to take advantage of those benefits, and I quickly archived the email and before I came to regret any further life decisions. However, something about the information stuck with me. I have been trying to take more time to consciously think through claims and statistics in this fake-news dominated age, and while this wasn\\u2019t on the same society-degrading level, something seemed off about the conclusion I had drawn. A few days later while listening to a data skeptic podcast it hit me: I had assumed that studying abroad caused students to have better grades and career prospects, when all the statistics showed was that the two were correlated. Most of us regularly make the mistake of unwittingly confusing correlation with causation, a tendency reinforced by media headlines like music lessons boost student\\u2019s performance or that staying in school is the secret to a long life. Sometimes, especially with health, these tend towards the unbelievable like a Guardian headline claiming a diet of fish leads to less violence. The common problem in these articles is that they take two correlated trends and present it as one phenomenon causing the other. The real explanation is usually much less exciting. For example, students who take music lessons may perform better in school, but they are also more likely to have grown up in an environment with a large emphasis on education and the resources needed to succeed academically. These students would therefore have higher school achievement with or without the music lessons. Taking music classes and school performance happen to rise in tandem because they are both products of a similar background, but one does not necessarily cause the other. Likewise, people who stay in school longer typically have more resources which also means they can afford better health care. Most of the time these mistakes are not made out of a deliberate effort to deceive (although that does occur) but out of an honest misunderstanding of the idea of causation. What the statistics, especially those in the study abroad email, show is a selection bias. In each study, the individuals observed do not come from a representative slice of society, but instead are all drawn from similar groups, leading to a skewed result. Think of the statistics showing students who study abroad are 19% more likely to graduate on time. While it might be possible that studying abroad did somehow motivate lagging students to graduate on time, the more likely explanation is that students who choose to go abroad were those in a better position academically in the first place. They would graduate on time with high GPAs regardless of whether they went to another country. It takes a lot of work and preparation to go to another country to study for a year, and the students who feel confident enough to do so are the ones who are on top of their studies. In this real-world case, the selection bias is towards better students. The sample of students who study abroad is not indicative of students as a whole, rather, it includes only the best-prepared students and therefore it is no surprise that this group has significantly better academic and career outcomes. The study abroad experience may look great in hindsight, but if we selected only the best students and had them do anything, it would be misleading to say the phenomenon led to better grades. Say for example we own a bottled water company and we want to gather some positive stats to help with sales. We hire a few students to stand outside the honors class and only give our water to the top students. We then conduct a study that shows conclusively that students who drink our brand get better grades. Because we selected a specific group of subjects to include in our study, we can make it look as though our water caused an increase in grades. The study abroad statistics come from what is known as an observational study. Rather than constructing an experiment, an observational study observes some process in the real world with no cannot control over the independent variable, in this case the students who chose to study abroad. Observational studies cannot prove cause and effect, only associations between different factors (such as achievement and studying in another country). In order to prove one process caused another requires a randomized controlled trial with subjects represent the entire population. In this case, carrying out a randomized controlled trial would require selecting a random subset of students across the range of academic performance, sending some to study abroad, and keeping a control group home. We could then analyze the results to determine if there were significant differences between the two groups. If there was, then we would probably carry out more studies controlling for more variables, until eventually we were satisfied there was no hidden effects and we could establish a causal relationship. I pointed these observations out to the CWRU Study Abroad Office and what followed was a decent and productive conversation. By posting about this, I was not trying to call out the office. Although the email did state: \\u201cHere are just some of the benefits this New Year\\u2019s Resolution can bring,\\u201d it wasn\\u2019t claiming an exact cause and effect. However, when a single topic is presented surrounded by a sea of facts, our natural inclination is to draw a causal link, a tendency marketers and companies take advantage of with regularity. I believe all the statistics in this case are valid, but we still need to avoid assigning a cause and effect relationship. Without randomized controlled trials, we cannot say one activity caused another, and all we can claim is that two trends are correlated. This is a small example, but it illustrates an extremely critical point: all of us, even grad students who use these concepts every single day, can be fooled by statistics. Humans naturally see patterns where they don\\u2019t exist, and we like to tell a cohesive story about what we think is going on (the narrative fallacy). However, the world usually does not have defined causes and effects, and we must settle for correlations. This view of the world may make headlines less exciting (it turns out chocolate is not a miraculous food), but it means you will not be fooled into buying products or taking actions that are not in your best interest due to questionable evidence. Moreover, we can share our experiences with others and create a skeptical community in which we make sound decisions for our benefit and not for a company\\u2019s bottom line. As always, I welcome constructive criticism and feedback. I can be reached on Twitter at @koehrsen_will. With so many high-quality options for studying machine learning, Coursera does not make the cut. Although I consider myself an ardent supporter of the democratization of education through online courses, I keep a healthy skeptical attitude towards what these classes can and cannot do. The Coursera Machine Learning Specialization from the University of Washington aims to help students \\u201cBuild Intelligent Applications. Master machine learning fundamentals.\\u201d On these two self-declared criteria, the course fails. Ultimately, the specialization serves at most as a high-level overview of basic machine learning topics, but upon graduation, students will be hard-pressed to apply any of the concepts to real problems on their own. It\\u2019s difficult to assign a rating because the course might be better-suited for some individuals than others, but, comparing it to both the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree and college courses, I would give it 2 out of 5. The shallow assignments and lack of an involved project means the course does not provide students with transferable skills. When I signed up for the specialization, it was with the promise of 4 separate courses and a hands-on capstone project. The four courses were each expected to take about 6 weeks to complete with 5\\u20138 hours of work per week and consisted of the following: fundamentals, regression, classification, and clustering/retrieval. Unbeknownst to me, the capstone was removed from the specialization, a fact difficult to figure out as numerous official Coursera emails and videos still referred to an application we would build ourselves. Had there been a capstone, my opinion might have changed, but I cannot recommend a class with no significant project requiring implementing course concepts. The specialization is broken into the four named sections, each with six or seven submodules. Each submodule consisted of a series of 5\\u201310 minute lecture videos produced by the University of Washington. I found the videos informative and helpful as the instructors outlined concepts and usually followed them up with a worked out example. The two instructors, both professors at Washington, explained concepts in an easy to follow manner. However, a course cannot rely on lectures alone, and in order to be effective, the ideas covered in class must be reinforced with homework. The Coursera specialization did provide numerous assignments, but they did not succeed in teaching students how to apply the concepts to new problems. Every submodule generally had one or two conceptual multiple-choice quizzes as well as one or two Jupyter Notebook assignments. The Jupyter Notebook has become a popular teaching tool because it is an interactive environment that includes code (Python for this course), text, and images in the same document. The Coursera notebooks looked well done, but unfortunately, the work required by students to complete the assignments was too simplistic to have any learning value. The notebooks had a number of fill-in-the-blanks in the code that students had to complete to get a correct answer. The notebooks themselves were not graded, instead, there was a short online quiz to complete based on the code output. Each fill-in-the-blank in the notebooks usually took 1 or 2 lines, and generally was unchallenging and repetitive. There were a few confusing exceptions when the required code was complex, leading to an exercise in boredom punctuated by frustration. The class assumes moderate knowledge of Python, but if you are taking this specialization to improve your programming skills, you will be disappointed. Students are never required to write a complete function, only short snippets within pre-defined functions. Any difficult code is already written in the notebook or hidden away in a separate script. The Jupyter Notebook is a great teaching tool when used correctly, but having students make exceedingly minor changes in a wall of code written by other people is not the ideal way to study machine learning. Going by Coursera\\u2019s schedule, the specialization should take about 6 months working at 5\\u20138 hours/week. At a cost of $50/month, that is $300 for the entire specialization. The way that the class works, you enroll in one of the four courses at a time and have certain deadlines you are supposed to meet. As far as I know, there is no actual penalty for missing the deadline other than increased cost as you can come back later and complete the work. I finished the class in 6 weeks, working about 10\\u201315 hours per week. The largest part of the time was spent watching the videos, which I felt did provide me with some benefit, but not $100 worth. The Jupyter Notebooks do not receive a passing grade as they did not reinforce the video concepts. I may be a little harsh on the Coursera Specialization because my expectations were based on the Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree (MLND) I recently completed. In contrast, the Udacity MLND, was a great learning experience. The videos were at least as good as those from Coursera, and were regularly followed up with conceptual and programming quizzes. This short reinforcement cycle helped to solidify the concepts in the videos. The Udacity degree also featured an extensive capstone project that was hand-reviewed by a human grader. Machine learning is studied best by doing, not watching, and Udacity has that figured out. The Udacity course (when I took it) was expected to last 6 months and cost $200/month. I completed it in 1 month doing 50 hours of work per week. Overall, I cannot recommend the Coursera Machine Learning Specialization. The class is not worth the time or cost investment without a capstone project. If you are self-motivated, for around $30, you can buy any number of great machine learning books, including Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow which taught me much more than this course! For people who want to make the investment, I do recommend Udacity\\u2019s MLND course, although there are also numerous free videos and example-based tutorials. In an age with so much quality content, we have to be selective, and Coursera\\u2019s Machine Learning Specialization does not make the cut. Have any questions about the Coursera Specialization or Udacity\\u2019s MLND? I can be reached on Twitter at @koehrsen_will Exploring financial data with object-oriented programming and additive models It\\u2019s easy to get carried away with the wealth of data and free open-source tools available for data science. After spending a little bit of time with the quandl financial library and the prophet modeling library, I decided to try some simple stock data exploration. Several days and 1000 lines of Python later, I ended up with a complete stock analysis and prediction tool. Although I am not confident (or foolish) enough to use it to invest in individual stocks, I learned a ton of Python in the process and in the spirit of open-source, want to share my results and code so others can benefit. This article will show how to use Stocker, a Python class-based tool for stock analysis and prediction (the name was originally arbitrary, but I decided after the fact it nicely stands for \\u201cstock explorer\\u201d). I had tried several times to conquer classes, the foundation of object-oriented programming in Python, but as with most programming topics, they never quite made sense to me when I read the books. It was only when I was deep in a project faced with a problem I had not solved before that the concept finally clicked, showing once again that experience beats theoretical explanations! In addition to an exploration of Stocker, we will touch on some important topics including the basics of a Python class and additive models. For anyone wanting to use Stocker, the complete code can be found on GitHub along with documentation for usage. Stocker was designed to be easy to use (even for those new to Python), and I encourage anyone reading to try it out. Now, let\\u2019s take a look at the analysis capabilities of Stocker! After installing the required libraries, the first thing we do is import the Stocker class into our Python session. We can do this from an interactive Python session or a Jupyter Notebook started in the directory with the script. We now have the Stocker class in our Python session, and we can use it to create an instance of the class. In Python, an instance of a class is called an object, and the act of creating an object is sometimes called instantiation or construction. In order to make a Stocker object we need to pass in the name of a valid stock ticker (bold indicates output). Now, we have a microsoftobject with all the properties of the Stocker class. Stocker is built on the quandl WIKI database which gives us access to over 3000 US stocks with years of daily price data (full list). For this example, we will stick to Microsoft data. Although Microsoft might be seen as the opposite of open-source, they have recently made some changes that make me optimist they are embracing the open-source community (including Python). A class in Python is comprised of two main parts: attributes and methods. Without going into too much detail, attributes are values or data associated either with the class as a whole or with specific instances (objects) of the class. Methods are functions contained in the class which can act on that data. One attribute of a Stocker object is stock data for a specific company that is attribute is associated with the object when we construct it. We can access the attribute and assign it to another variable for inspection: The benefit of a Python class is that the methods (functions) and the data they act on are associated with the same object. We can use a method of the Stocker object to plot the entire history of the stock. The default value plotted is the Adjusted Closing price, which accounts for splits in the stock (when one stock is split into multiple stocks, say 2, with each new stock worth 1/2 of the original price). This is a pretty basic plot that we could have found from a Google Search, but there is something satisfying about doing it ourselves in a few lines of Python! The plot_stockfunction has a number of optional arguments. By default, this method plots the Adjusted Closing price for the entire date range, but we can choose the range, the stats to plot, and the type of plot. For example, if we want to compare the Daily Change in price with the Adjusted Volume (number of shares) traded, we can specify those in the function call. Notice the y-axis is in percentage change relative to the average value for the statistic. This scale is necessary because the daily volume is originally in shares, with a range in the hundreds of millions, while daily price change typically is a few dollars! By converting to percentage change we can look at both datasets on a similar scale. The plot shows there is no correlation between the number of shares traded and the daily change in price. This is surprising as we might have expected more shares to be traded on days with larger price changes as people rush to take advantage of the swings. However, the only real trend seems to be that the volume traded decreases over time. There is also a significant decrease in price on December 4, 2017 that we could try to correlate with news stories about Microsoft. A quick news search for December 3 yields the following: There certainly does not seem to be any indication that Microsoft stock is due for its largest price decrease in 10 years the next day! In fact, if we were playing the stock market based on news, we might have been tempted to buy stock because a deal with the NFL (second result) sounds like a positive! Using plot_stock,we can investigate any of the quantities in the data across any date range and look for correlations with real-world events (if there are any). For now, we will move on to one of the more enjoyable parts of Stocker: making fake money! Let\\u2019s pretend for a moment we had the presence of mind to invest in 100 shares of Microsoft at the company\\u2019s Initial Public Offering (IPO). How much richer would we be now? In addition to making us feel better, using these results will allow us to plan our trips back in time to maximize profits. If we are feeling too confident, we can try to tweak the results to lose money: Surprisingly, it is possible to lose money in the stock market! Additive models are a powerful tool for analyzing and predicting time series, one of the most common types of real world data. The concept is straightforward: represent a time series as a combination of patterns on different time scales and an overall trend. We know the long-term trend of Microsoft stock is a steady increase, but there could also be patterns on a yearly or daily basis, such as an increase every Tuesday, that would be economically beneficial to know. A great library for analyzing time series with daily observations (such as stocks) is Prophet, developed by Facebook. Stocker does all the modeling work with Prophet behind the scenes for us, so we can use a simple method call to create and inspect a model. The additive model smooths out the noise in the data, which is why the modeled line does not exactly line up with the observations. Prophet models also calculate uncertainty, an essential part of modeling as we can never be sure of our predictions when dealing with fluctuating real life processes. We can also use a prophet model to make predictions for the future, but for now we are more concerned with past data. Notice that this method call returned two objects, a model and some data, which we assigned to variables. We now use these variables to plot the time series components. The overall trend is a definitive increase over the past three years. There also appears to be a noticeable yearly pattern (bottom graph), with prices bottoming out in September and October and reaching a peak in November and January. As the time-scale decreases, the data gets noisier. Over the course of a typical month, there is more signal than noise! If we believe there might be a weekly pattern, we can add that in to the prophet model by changing the weekly_seasonalityattribute of the Stocker object: The default value for weekly_seasonalityis False, but we changed the value to include a weekly pattern in our model. We then make another call to create_prophet_modeland graph the resulting components. Below is the weekly seasonality from the new model. We can ignore the weekends because the price only changes over the week (in reality the price changes by a small amount during after-hours training but it does not affect our analysis). Unfortunately, there is not a trend over the week that we can use and before we continue modeling, we will turn off the weekly seasonality. This behavior is expected: with stock data, as the time scale decreases, the noise starts to wash out the signal. On a day-to-day basis, the movements of stocks are essentially random, and it is only by zooming out to the yearly scale that we can see trends. Hopefully this serves as a good reminder of why not to play the daily stock game! Changepoints occur when a time-series goes from increasing to decreasing or vice versa (in a more rigorous sense, they are located where the change in the rate of the time series is greatest). These times are extremely important because knowing when a stock will reach a peak or is about to take off could have significant economic benefits. Identifying the causes of changepoints might let us predict future swings in the value of a stock. The Stocker object can automatically find the 10 largest changepoints for us. The changepoints tend to line up with peaks and valleys in the stock price. Prophet only finds changepoints in the first 80% of the data, but nonetheless, these results are useful because we can attempt to correlate them with real-world events. We could repeat what we did earlier and manually search for Google News around these dates, but I thought it would be preferable if Stocker did that for us. You might have seen the Google Search Trends tool which allows you to see the popularity of any search term over time in Google searches. Stocker can automatically retrieve this data for any search term we specify and plot the result on the original data. To find and graph the frequency of a search term, we modify the previous method call. In addition to graphing the relative search frequency, Stocker displays the top related queries and the top rising queries for the date range of the graph. On the graph, the y-axis is normalized between 0 and 1 by dividing the values by their maximums, allowing us to compare two variables with different scales. From the figure, there does not appear to be a correlation between searches for \\u201cMicrosoft profit\\u201d and the stock price of Microsoft. Had we found a correlation, there would still be the question of causation. We would not know if searches or news caused the price to change, or if the change in price caused the searches. There might be some useful information to be found, but there are also many chance correlations. (For a humorous take on such random relationships, check out spurious correlations). Feel free to try out some different terms to see if you can find any interesting trends! Looks like declining searches for Office leads to increasing stock prices. Maybe someone should let Microsoft know. We have only explored the first half of Stocker capabilities. The second half is designed for forecasting, or predicting future stock price. Although this might be a futile exercise (or at least will not pay off), there is still plenty to learn in the process! Stay tuned for a future article on prediction, or get started predicting with Stocker on your own (check out the documentation for details). For now, I\\u2019ll leave you with one more image. Although all the capabilities of Stocker might already be publically available, the process of creating this tool was enjoyable, and more importantly, taught me more about data science, Python, and the stock market than any college course could. We live in an incredible age of democratized knowledge where anyone can learn about programming or even state of the art fields like machine learning without formal instruction. If you have an idea for a project but think you do not know enough or find out it has been done before, don\\u2019t let that stop you. You might develop a better solution and even if you don\\u2019t, you\\u2019ll be better off and know more than if you had never started! As always, I welcome constructive criticism and feedback. I can be reached on twitter at @koehrsen_will. Additive models for time series modeling Time series are one of the most common data types encountered in daily life. Financial prices, weather, home energy usage, and even weight are all examples of data that can be collected at regular intervals. Almost every data scientist will encounter time series in their daily work and learning how to model them is an important skill in the data science toolbox. One powerful yet simple method for analyzing and predicting periodic data is the additive model. The idea is straightforward: represent a time-series as a combination of patterns at different scales such as daily, weekly, seasonally, and yearly, along with an overall trend. Your energy use might rise in the summer and decrease in the winter, but have an overall decreasing trend as you increase the energy efficiency of your home. An additive model can show us both patterns/trends and make predictions based on these observations. The following image shows an additive model decomposition of a time-series into an overall trend, yearly trend, and weekly trend. This post will walk through an introductory example of creating an additive model for financial time-series data using Python and the Prophet forecasting package developed by Facebook. Along the way, we will cover some data manipulation using pandas, accessing financial data using the Quandl library and, and plotting with matplotlib. I have included code where it is instructive, and I encourage anyone to check out the Jupyter Notebook on GitHub for the full analysis. This introduction will show you all the steps needed to start modeling time-series on your own! Disclaimer: Now comes the boring part when I have to mention that when it comes to financial data, past performance is no indicator of future performance and you cannot use the methods here to get rich. I chose to use stock data because it is easily available on a daily frequency and fun to play around with. If you really want to become wealthy, learning data science is a better choice than playing the stock market! Usually, about 80% of the time spent on a data science project is getting and cleaning data. Thanks to the quandl financial library, that was reduced to about 5% for this project. Quandl can be installed with pip from the command line, lets you access thousands of financial indicators with a single line of Python, and allows up to 50 requests a day without signing up. If you sign up for a free account, you get an api key that allows unlimited requests. First, we import the required libraries and get some data. Quandl automatically puts our data into a pandas dataframe, the data structure of choice for data science. (For other companies, just replace the \\u2018TSLA\\u2019 or \\u2018GM\\u2019 with the stock ticker. You can also specify a date range). There is an almost unlimited amount of data on quandl, but I wanted to focus on comparing two companies within the same industry, namely Tesla and General Motors. Tesla is a fascinating company not only because it is the first successful American car start-up in 111 years, but also because at times in 2017 it was the most valuable car company in America despite only selling 4 different cars. The other contender for the title of most valuable car company is General Motors which recently has shown signs of embracing the future of cars by building some pretty cool (but not cool-looking) all-electric vehicles. We could easily have spent hours searching for this data and downloading it as csv spreadsheet files, but instead, thanks to quandl, we have all the data we need in a few seconds! Before we can jump into modeling, it\\u2019s best to get an idea of the structure and ranges by making a few exploratory plots. This will also allows us to look for outliers or missing values that need to be corrected. Pandas dataframes can be easily plotted with matplotlib. If any of the graphing code looks intimidating, don\\u2019t worry. I also find matplotlib to be unintuitive and often copy and paste examples from Stack Overflow or documentation to get the graph I want. One of the rules of programming is don\\u2019t reinvent a solution that already exists! Comparing the two companies on stock prices alone does not show which is more valuable because the total value of a company (market capitalization) also depends on the number of shares (Market cap= share price * number of shares). Quandl does not have number of shares data, but I was able to find average yearly stock shares for both companies with a quick Google search. Is is not exact, but will be accurate enough for our analysis. Sometimes we have to make do with imperfect data! To create a column of market cap in our dataframe,we use a few tricks with pandas, such as moving the index to a column (reset_index) and simultaneously indexing and altering values in the dataframe using ix. This creates a \\u2018cap\\u2019 column for Tesla. We do the same process with the GM data and then merge the two. Merging is an essential part of a data science workflow because it allows us to join datasets on a shared column. In this case, we have stock prices for two different companies on the same dates and we therefore want to join the data on the date column. We perform an \\u2018inner\\u2019 merge to save only Date entries that are present in both dataframes. After merging, we rename the columns so we know which one goes with which car company. The market cap is in billions of dollars. We can see General Motors started off our period of analysis with a market cap about 30 times that of Tesla! Do things stay that way over the entire timeline? We observe a meteoric rise for Tesla and a minor increase for General Motors over the course of the data. Tesla even surpasses GM in value during 2017! During that period, Tesla sold about 48,000 cars while GM sold 1,500,000. GM was valued less than Tesla during a period in which it sold 30 times more cars! This definitely displays the power of a persuasive executive and a high-quality \\u2014 if extremely low-quantity \\u2014 product. Although the value of Tesla is now lower than GM, a good question might be, can we expect Tesla to again surpass GM? When will this happen? For that we turn to additive models for forecasting, or in other words, predicting the future. The Facebook Prophet package was released in 2017 for Python and R, and data scientists around the world rejoiced. Prophet is designed for analyzing time series with daily observations that display patterns on different time scales. It also has advanced capabilities for modeling the effects of holidays on a time-series and implementing custom changepoints, but we will stick to the basic functions to get a model up and running. Prophet, like quandl, can be installed with pip from the command line. We first import prophet and rename the columns in our data to the correct format. The Date column must be called \\u2018ds\\u2019 and the value column we want to predict \\u2018y\\u2019. We then create prophet models and fit them to the data, much like a Scikit-Learn machine learning model: When creating the prophet models, I set the changepoint prior to 0.15, up from the default value of 0.05. This hyperparameter is used to control how sensitive the trend is to changes, with a higher value being more sensitive and a lower value less sensitive. This value is used to combat one of the most fundamental trade-offs in machine learning: bias vs. variance. If we fit too closely to our training data, called overfitting, we have too much variance and our model will not be able to generalize well to new data. On the other hand, if our model does not capture the trends in our training data it is underfitting and has too much bias. When a model is underfitting, increasing the changepoint prior allows more flexibility for the model to fit the data, and if the model is overfitting, decreasing the prior limits the amount of flexibility. The effect of the changepoint prior scale can be illustrated by graphing predictions made with a range of values: The higher the changepoint prior scale, the more flexible the model and the closer it fits to the training data. This may seem like exactly what we want, but learning the training data too well can lead to overfitting and an inability to accurately make predictions on new data. We therefore need to find the right balance of fitting the training data and being able to generalize to new data. As stocks vary from day-to-day, and we want our model to capture this, I increased the flexibility after experimenting with a range of values. In the call to create a prophet model, we can also specify changepoints, which occur when a time-series goes from increasing to decreasing, or from increasing slowly to increasing rapidly (they are located where the rate change in the time series is greatest). Changepoints can correspond to significant events such as product launches or macroeconomic swings in the market. If we do not specify changepoints, prophet will calculate them for us. To make forecasts, we need to create what is called a future dataframe. We specify the number of future periods to predict (two years) and the frequency of predictions (daily). We then make predictions with the prophet model we created and the future dataframe: Our future dataframes contain the estimated market cap of Tesla and GM for the next two years. We can visualize predictions with the prophet plot function. The black dots represent the actual values (notice how they stop at the beginning of 2018), the blue line indicates the forecasted values, and the light blue shaded region is the uncertainty (always a critical part of any prediction). The region of uncertainty increases the further out in the future the prediction is made because initial uncertainty propagates and grows over time. This is observed in weather forecasts which get less accurate the further out in time they are made. We can also inspect changepoints identified by the model. Again, changepoints represent when the time series growth rate significantly changes (goes from increasing to decreasing for example). For comparison, we can look at the Google Search Trends for Tesla over this time range to see if the changes line up. We plot the changepoints (vertical lines) and search trends on the same graph: Some of the changepoints in the market value of Tesla align with changes in frequency of Tesla searches, but not all of them. From this, I would say that relative Google search frequency is not a great indicator of stock changes. We still need to figure out when the market capitalization of Tesla will surpass that of General Motors. Since we have both predictions for the next two years we can plot both companies on the same graph after merging the dataframes. Before merging, we rename the columns to keep track of the data. First we will plot just the estimate. The estimate (called \\u2018yhat\\u2019 in the prophet package) smooths out some of the noise in the data so it looks a little different than the raw plots. The level of smoothness will depend on the changepoint prior scale \\u2014 higher priors mean a more flexible model and more ups and downs. Our model thinks the brief surpassing of GM by Tesla in 2017 was just noise, and it is not until early 2018 that Tesla beats out GM for good in the forecast. The exact date is January 27, 2018, so if that happens, I will gladly take credit for predicting the future! When making the above graph, we left out the most important part of a forecast: the uncertainty! We can use matplotlib (see notebook) to show the regions of doubt: This is a better representation of the prediction. It shows the value of both companies is expected to increase, but Tesla will increase more rapidly than General Motors. Again, the uncertainty increases over time as expected for a prediction and the lower bound of Tesla is below the upper bound of GM in 2020 meaning GM might retain the lead. The last step of the market capitalization analysis is looking at the overall trend and patterns. Prophet allows us to easily visualize the overall trend and the component patterns: The trend is pretty clear: GM stock is rising and going to keep rising. The yearly pattern is interesting because it seems to suggest GM increases in value at the end of the year with a long slow decline into the summer. We can try to determine if there is a correlation between the yearly market cap and the average monthly sales of GM over the time period. I first gathered the monthly vehicle sales from Google and then averaged over the months using groupby. This is another critical data science operation, because often we want to compare stats between categories, such as users of a specific age group, or vehicles from one manufacturer. In this case, we want to calculate average sales in each month, so we group the months together and then average the sales. It does not look like monthly sales are correlated with the market cap. The monthly sales are second highest in August, which is right at the lowest point for the market cap! Looking at the weekly trend, there does not appear to be any meaningful signal (there are no stock prices recorded on the weekends so we look at the change during the week).This is to be expected as the random walk theory in economics states there is no predictable pattern in stock prices on a daily basis. As evidenced by our analysis, in the long run, stocks tend to increase, but on a day-to-day scale, there is almost no pattern that we can take advantage of even with the best models. A simple look at the Dow Jones Industrial Average (a market index of the 30 largest companies on the stock exchange) nicely illustrates this point: Clearly, the message is to go back to 1900 and invest your money! Or in reality, when the market drops, don\\u2019t withdraw because it will go back up according to history. On the overall scale, the day-to-day fluctuations are too small to even be seen and if we are thinking like data scientists, we realize that playing daily stocks is foolish compared to investing in the entire market and holding for long periods of time. Prophet can also be applied to larger-scale data measures, such as Gross Domestic Product, a measure of the overall size of a country\\u2019s economy. I made the following forecast by creating prophet models based on the historical GDP of the US and China. The exact date China will surpass the US in GDP is 2036! This model is limited because of the low frequency of the observations (GDP is measured once per quarter but prophet works best with daily data), but it provides a basic prediction with no macroeconomic knowledge required. There are many ways to model time-series, from simple linear regression to recurrent neural networks with LSTM cells. Additive Models are useful because they are quick to develop, fast to train, provide interpretable patterns, and make predictions with uncertainties. The capabilities of Prophet are impressive and we have only scratched the surface here. I encourage you to use this article and the notebook to explore some of the data offered by Quandl or your own time series. Stay tuned for future work on time series analysis, and for an application of prophet to my daily life, see my post on using these techniques to model and predict weight change. As a first step in exploring time-series, additive models in Python are the way to go! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached at wjk68@case.edu. Review of The Signal and the Noise by Nate Silver The Signal and the Noise is probably the most informative non-technical book about the art of predicting ever written. It outlines what is best described as Nate Silver\\u2019s \\u201cTheory of Prediction\\u201d. Silver, creator of the data journalism site fivethirtyeight, takes readers through an information trip of diverse fields including meteorology, baseball, poker, finance, and politics, documenting estimates that either failed badly, or were extremely successful and the tactics employed by the forecasters who made them. Both the successful and the failed forecasts have much to teach us, and Silver distills the lessons from these examples into a cohesive message: we are inherently terrible at making predictions, but by adopting a few principles, we can improve our estimates and benefit at the personal and national level. In my view, there principles fall under three rules: It\\u2019s hard to make out much about these rules from their names, so let\\u2019s walk through each one in turn. At the outset of the book, Silver relates the contrasting viewpoints of the hedgehog and the fox as put forth by the philosopher Isiah Berlin. While the hedgehog has one big idea, the fox has many small ideas. Everyone tends to fall on one side or the other: we either believe in a black and white world with well-defined boundaries, or a gray world in which nothing is ever completely certain. Each point of view has its own merits, but when it comes to prediction, the foxes will be significantly more successful. A fox can draw on a diverse range of sources and assume different perspectives but the hedgehog is locked into a single line of thought. This is best related to predictions through a simple example. Let\\u2019s say we are in a country with only two political parties (how ludicrous a concept!), the bears and the tigers. We are vying against a rival forecaster trying to outperform him on predictions for the upcoming election. Whoever wins will be put on the prime news channel for the next four years. Our rival is a classic hedgehog; his one big idea is that the tigers will sweep every single one of the next elections. On the other hand, we have made the rational decision to be more fox-like. We believe that indeed the overall trend favors tigers, but we are willing to look at individual races where the story-line may not be straightforward. When it\\u2019s time to make our predictions, we examine each race in turn, looking at all the relevant news and averaging multiple polls to select a winner. Our rival confidently picks tigers for every race, backing up his picks with the assertion that his view of the world is infallible. In the end, we handily win and have the honor of appearing on the news every night for the next four years because we were willing to see the nuance whereas our rival was blinded by a single idea. This may be a contrived example, but it shows the dangers in adopting a simplistic right/wrong view of the world. When you are a hedgehog and hold only one belief, such as that the tigers will win all the elections, every piece of new information you hear will confirm your beliefs. You will gladly put all your faith in the pro-tiger papers and ignore any conflicting evidence. Meanwhile, as foxes, we have no existing biases and are willing to objectively evaluate each and every source of data. The hedgehogs suffer from confirmation bias, where there manipulate any evidence to fit their viewpoint. The foxes produce more accurate predictions because of their willingness to approach any problem with an open mind. In reality, it can be difficult to shed all of our pre-conceived beliefs, but we can work to counter them by collecting information from as many sources as possible as fivethirtyeight does when constructing election predictions. Unfortunately, in the real world as Silver points out, hedgehogs often are readily handed a bullhorn to broadcast their message. With tv news and the internet fracturing into two political sides with a massive no-man\\u2019s land in between, people still in the middle are overwhelmed by the fanatics at the extremes. When people tune into a news channel, they are not looking for objective coverage, they want to hear that their side is right. When it comes to predictions, they would rather listen to the hedgehog telling them their \\u201cteam\\u201d will sweep the legislative branch than the fox with her wise forecasts detailing each race based on objective data. Thus, the majority of forecasters who appear on tv and in the news are hedgehogs who make bold claims and not foxes who make reasonable but less exciting predictions. Despite evidence that those who make more extreme predictions are the worst predictors, they get the majority of screen time. Nonetheless, this does not prevent us from being foxes in our day-to-day lives. In order to think like a fox, we need to shed our pre-conceived beliefs, collect information from diverse sources, listen to both sides of an argument, and make reasonable predictions that reflect the gray nature of the world. Before you are scared off by the strange sound of \\u201cBayesian,\\u201d let me explain: Thomas Bayes was a statistician and minister in the 18th century known for formulating methods on how to update our beliefs about the world based on new evidence. When we approach any new prediction problem, we first need to form an initial estimate of the situation, called a prior. Let\\u2019s say we want to predict whether or not we will get a promotion at the start of the next quarter. It\\u2019s one month out, and because we have been more productive lately and are on good terms with our manager, we can put the initial odds at 50%. The idea behind Bayes\\u2019 theorem (the formal version of his ideas) is as we gather information related to the problem, we update our first estimate in accordance with the data. If our manager sends us an email praising our work, we might increase the probability of a promotion to 75%. As the date of the event grows closer, our prediction should converge on the true probability if we are incorporating all relevant information. Evidence is weighted according to how much it decreases our uncertainty. The prior is taken into account at each step, but as the amount of new information (observations) increases, the weight of the prior in the prediction decreases. Our final prediction is a combination of the initial estimate and the observed data. We use Bayesian reasoning all the time in our daily lives. When watching a sports event, we have an idea at the outset what the end result will be, and as the game progresses, we update that estimate, until by the end, we can be 100% sure of the result. Likewise, the stock market rises and falls as a result of news because investors believe the information reveals something about the worth of a company. The Bayes\\u2019 point of view is in contrast to what is called the frequentist worldview, where the chance of something occurring is based only on the observed frequency of the event in past data. When forecasting the chance of snow on January 21, 2018 from two weeks out, the frequentist would predict the average chance of snow on that day and stick with that estimate until the day in question. As a Bayesian however, we would make an initial forecast, perhaps using the historical occurrence as a starting point, and then revise our estimate as the day got closer based on new information. Warmer than average weather might decrease our predicted probability for snow while a snowstorm approaching from the west would increase it. The Bayesian is naturally at an advantage for making predictions because she is constantly changing her beliefs in response to evidence. Another critical aspect of Bayesian thinking is that predictions are expressed as a probability rather than a yes/no. Although most people tend to want a straight answer, we live in an uncertain world where a yes or no is not completely possible. Any prediction will have uncertainty, and when someone makes a prediction that the stock market will go up tomorrow, they are obscuring that there is actually a range of possible values the stock market could take. The most likely scenario may be an increase, but there will always be the chance of a decrease. Again, answering prediction problems with a range of values or a probability with likely not get us a spot on the news, but it will mean that we will on average be closer to the truth. Responsible data scientists and forecasters must communicate results with the attached uncertainty. Answering with a range of values should not be interpreted as a lack of confidence but rather a reflection of the shifting state of the world. The optimal way to get good at anything is to fail at it many times and make adjustments. The best basketball shooters in the world fail about half the time, but they do not let that deter them from taking another shot. Each time they shoot and miss, they make minor adjustments, and then take another shot. While repeatedly failing may be difficult in some domains (it\\u2019s great that we invented airplane simulators to allow pilots the luxury of failing more than once), it is easy to implement in situations where the stakes are minor and we can receive immediate feedback. Predictions, at least on a personal level, fit these conditions perfectly. We can very easily (and safely) predict our weight a week from now, the score of our favorite team\\u2019s next game, or the optimal length of time to cook popcorn without suffering dire consequences. The world would have a severe shortage of meteorologists if everyone was held to perfect standards for predictions. Instead, every time we miss the mark, we examine the causes of our failure, and make adjustments we think will help us for the next time. Anyone can fail often, but it\\u2019s about examining and using mistakes to improve our performance. Silver\\u2019s team infamously failed at predicting the 2016 elections, and afterwards, they took a long look at what they had done wrong. Fivethirtyeight does not conduct polls, but aggregates a wide variety, weighting each one based on historical performance. In the case of 2016, it was clear that the polls were systematically biased towards Hillary Clinton which Silver and his team will undoubtedly take that into account for the next round of elections. Silver also documents a baseball model that made absolutely ridiculous predictions, which, on inspection was caused by a single mis-typed letter. Had the creators dumped the model after the failures, their development time would have been wasted, but they had the wisdom to keep making new predictions and mistakes to isolate the problem. Thinking like a shooter involves repeating the shoot \\u2014 miss \\u2014 adjust \\u2014 shoot cycle continuously, improving performance with each iteration. There are limitations to any prediction model as Silver points out throughout the book. Humans have a tendency to see patterns where there are none, noticeably in the case of chance correlations. The Super Bowl indicator, which is supposed to predict the performance of the stock market based on which league wins the Super Bowl has been correct 40 out of the past 50 years. However, there is no macroeconomic effect whereby the winner of the NFL championship influences the markets and it is only a surprising correlation. Moreover, some systems, such as the weather, are extremely sensitive to initial conditions (these fall under the intriguing field of chaos theory). One minor change at the start of a weather simulation can lead to drastically different forecasts, which is why predicting the weather and climate is notoriously difficult. Nevertheless, thanks to many failures over time, weather prediction has improved remarkably in the past several decades. Weather services create hundreds of billions of dollars in value due to reduced damages from storms because of storm warnings and better harvests due to climate predictions. Although we normally tend to prefer a simple model, sometimes we need a massive, complicated model for accurate predictions. Another type of problem where predictions fail is out-of-sample situations. These are situations that have never before occurred in our data and therefore are nearly impossible to see coming. Consider a pilot who has made the flight from Houston to New York 800 times without incident in clear weather. On his next flight, a massive hurricane is impacting the East Coast and the airline must decide weather or not to cancel his flight. The pilot argues that he has never crashed before and therefore there is no chance of him running into trouble on this flight. However, this is an out-of-sample situation because each of his previous flights were made under perfect conditions. In this case the prudent measure would be to ground the flight because there is too much uncertainty. The attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese is often considered an out-of-sample event because no major attack by a foreign power of that scale had ever before occurred on US soil. Despite indications Japan was preparing for a large military operation, the US failed to predict the event. The signal was there but was ignored because an attack like Pearl Harbor had never before occurred. In this age of blind belief in big data and complex models, Silver takes a needed critical view of predictions that rely only on statistics. Drawing on his past experience with baseball models, Silver explains how computers alone often cannot capture all of the intricacies in many human pursuits. He found that his own numbers-only based models under-performed those built using both human intuition and data. Likewise, after computers beat the best chess players for the first time, it was predicted that humans had lost all relevance in the game. However, subsequent open world championships that allowed any combination of people and computers to compete were won by teams that used both a program and humans with knowledge of the game. In most fields, it is a good bet that domain knowledge plus computer models will surpass predictions relying on either alone. My method for judging a book is whether I could get all the relevant information in a five-minute summary, or if reading the entire book is worthwhile for the extra insights. In the case of The Signal and the Noise, I recommend reading the whole work. In this post, I outlined the basics of the book but skipped over nearly all the real-world examples Silver uses to illustrate each one of his points. The book covers many statistical concepts in an intuitive style, and for an academic-seeming topic such as predictions, was quite readable. Anyone aspiring to be a data scientist or who wants to examine forecasts skeptically should read this informative work on the methods of accurate predictions. Charting the Great Weight Challenge of 2017 One frustration I often hear from those learning data science is that it is difficult to make the leap from toy examples in books to real-world problems. Any learning process must necessarily start off with simple problems, but at some point we need to move beyond curated examples and into messy, human-generated data. This graphic pretty well sums up what I\\u2019ve gone through in my data science education, and although I\\u2019m not yet over the cursing mountain, I have climbed part of the way up through trying (and often failing) at numerous projects with real data: The best way to ascend this curve is build up your confidence over time, and there is no better place to start than a project directly related to your life. This post will demonstrate a straightforward application of data science to my health and that of my dad, a personal problem with clear benefits if there ever was one! The good news is that in order to apply data science for your personal benefit, you don\\u2019t need the data or resources of a massive tech firm, just a consistent set of measurements and free open-source analysis tools such as R and Python. If you stop to look, you will find data streams all around you waiting to be tracked. You might step onto a scale every morning and, depending on the outcome, congratulate or denigrate yourself, and then forget about it until the next day. However, taking a few seconds and recording a once-daily weight in a spreadsheet can yield a useful and clean dataset in a few months (and increases the chances that you will hit your goal). This data is perfect for allowing you to develop your data science skills on a real problem. At its core, data science is fundamentally about drawing intelligence from data and this post is an illustration of how data science can yield insights that improve real-world outcomes. Data science is a multi-disciplinary field \\u2014 composed of computer science, statistics, and engineering \\u2014 but the most vital aspect is also the most overlooked: communication. Your analysis could be great, but at the end of the day, managers, professors, and the general public care more about the final result than the exact methods. Being able to clearly communicate an answer to a data science question and the limitations of an analysis is a valuable asset in any data science toolbox. In this post, I have left out all of the code (done in R) used to create the graphs in order to focus on the results and what we can learn from them, but all code is available on the project GitHub page for anyone who wants to see how the magic happens. Likewise, the data is on GitHub and on Google Drive as a csv file for those wanting to follow along. I have also tried to provide resources on specific topics for those wanting to learn more. Now, it\\u2019s time to dive into the data science of the Great Weight Challenge of 2017! Disclaimer: First, all data presented in this project is real! My dad and I both believe in open data (up to a point) and we definitely don\\u2019t care about making ourselves look more successful than we are. Second, I will not try to sell you any weight loss products (although I did consider calling this post \\u201cHow to Lose Weight with Data Science\\u201d). Having good-naturedly teased each other for years about our respective struggles \\u2014 mine to gain weight, and his to lose weight \\u2014 my dad and I decided the best solution was a weight change competition. My dad\\u2019s performance would be measured by pounds lost, and mine by pounds gained. The only rules were: we had to weigh in once a day, the competition started on August 18 and ended January 1, 2018, and the loser had to pay the winner double the winner\\u2019s weight change in pounds. Because this is a real-world problem with actual people, neither the first nor the second rule was completely upheld! Nonetheless, over the course of the competition (which actually ended Jan 6), we gathered over 100 data points each, more than enough to yield many intriguing conclusions. We both decided to be as open about the challenge as possible and told family and friends about the competition to force us to follow through. After receiving plenty of well-intended advice, we drew up respective strategies. I decided to start eating lunching as I had developed an unhealthy habit of skipping the mid-day meal to focus on my work as an intern at NASA. My dad wanted to eat exactly the same diet but reduce portion sizes. This seemed like a wise decision because it meant he did not have to think about dieting, but made the same foods and served them on smaller plates. He also resolved to work on the exercise side by taking long walks, emphasizing the need not for a short-term weight-loss plan, but a healthier overall lifestyle. Might as well start with the entire results graph. So that\\u2019s it right? The whole competition summed up in one picture. Well, not entirely. It\\u2019s a good start, but there is plenty of insight to be drawn from working our way into the data. The lines drawn through the data are models made using the \\u2018loess\\u2019 regression method, while the points are the actual measurements. Right away we can see that both of us went in the right direction! However, this graph obscures a lot of information. We can\\u2019t even judge who won! For that we can turn to a plot showing each of our weight changes in pounds from the starting weight. We are using absolute values here so a higher number is better. We can clearly see that while the competition was initially close, my dad (Craig) pulled away at the end and won by a considerable margin. Congrats dad! Another takeaway is that weight measurements are quite noisy. We tried to take data at the same time every day, first thing in the morning, on the same scale, but there are so many factors that influence weight from day-to-day that looking at a single point is meaningless. It is only by examining a series of data points that a trend emerges. Additionally, each of our weight changes seems to resemble a square root relationship or a logarithm. That is, there is an initial rapid gain (or loss) that then levels off over time. This was expected because initially it is quite easy to make progress when you are motivated, but it can be difficult to keep up the momentum. Eventually we both settled into weight plateaus with the very final measurements showing slight signs of improvement that may or may not be trends. One slight issue with this result is it does not take body weight into account. If my dad loses 10 lbs, that is smaller relative to his body weight than if I gain 10 lbs. The next graph also shows changes, but this time in terms of percentage of body weight. Well, if you were rooting for me, things look much better in this graph. My percentage change was larger for most of the competition, and I was ahead until the last day when my dad just edged me in terms of percentage. It is interesting that both of us settled into a total change near 6% of body weight. This might suggest our bodies can fluctuate within a +- 6% range easily, but beyond that, further change is more difficult. Presented below are the final numerical results. Graphs can show us much information and qualitative trends quickly, but do not answer questions with a quantitative result. For instance, how much weight did each of us gain or lose on average per day? What is our predicted weight one year from now using all the data? These are questions that we must turn to modeling to answer. Simple Linear Modeling The best place to start with any modeling where we have a continuous variable such as weight is a simple linear regression approach. We will create a linear model with one response (y) variable and one explanatory (x) variable. We are interested in the relationship between weight and days since the start of the competition, therefore, the response is weight and the explanatory variable is days. From the graphs, we have seen this may not be the best representation of the data, but it is a good place to begin and allows us to quantity our respective weight changes. Craig\\u2019s model results are presented below. There is a lot of information here, but I\\u2019ll walk through it and point out what is important. The main parts to examine are the parameters, the numbers that define the model. In the case of a simple linear model these are the intercept and the slope as shown in the equation for a straight line: y = mx + b. For the weight challenge, this model becomes: weight = (weight change per day) * days + weight at zero days. The weight at zero days in the above summary is in the (intercept) row under the estimate column with a value of 227.78 lbs. The weight change per day is in the days row under the estimate column with a value of -0.024 lbs/day. This means, that under a linear model, my dad lost an average of 0.024 lbs per day on average. The other statistics presented above are slightly more detailed, but also informative. The R-squared represents the fraction of the in variation in the y variable (weight) which can be explained by the variation in the x variable (days). A higher R-Squared means the model better represents the data and we can see our model only accounts for 11.96% of the variation in weight. Additionally, we can look at the p-value to see if there is a real trend in our model or if our data is simply noise. A p-value is a common statistic that represents the chance of the observed data occurring at random under the model. For Craig\\u2019s model, the p-value is 0.0002642 which falls well below the generally accepted significance threshold of 0.05 (lower is better for a p-value because it means the data is less likely to have been generated by chance). Therefore, the chance that my dad\\u2019s weight loss is simply random noise is less than 3 in 10000. From this model, we can conclude that my dad\\u2019s weight loss over the course of the competition is a real trend! We can now turn to my simple linear regression model for a similar analysis. The model summary shows an intercept of 131.9 lbs, a weight change per day of 0.0095 lbs, an R-Squared of 0.04502, and a p-value of 0.01847. Our conclusions are: The p-value for my model is slightly higher than that for my dad, but it still falls below the significance threshold and the model shows a real trend. We can visualize how well linear models fit the data by slightly altering the full results code and changing the model trend line from \\u2018loess\\u2019 to linear. The takeaway from linear modeling is that my dad and I both demonstrated significant progress towards our weight change goals over the challenge. A generalized additive model goes beyond the linear relationship assumption of a simple linear model and represents a time-series (weight in this case) as a combination (addition) of an overall trend, and daily, weekly, or yearly patterns. This approach works very well for real-world data that often exhibits specific patterns. Our data was collected once a day for about 4 months, so there are only weekly patterns and an overall trend (to have daily patterns would require multiple observations per day). Nevertheless, we still are able to draw useful conclusions from an additive model. We can first plot the overall trend. This is similar to the smooth line we saw in the full results graph and shows us the overall trajectory of weight change. The next graph shows weekly trends in terms of weight lost or gained on each day of the week. This plot has actionable information because it shows which days are problems for our weight change objectives. Although my dad and I were trying to go in opposite directions, we had very similar weekly patterns. We both lost weight in the first two days of the work week, gained weight during the rest of the work week and trended downwards over the weekend. It is possible to read too much into this plots, but my interpretation for myself is that I tended to get much more exercise on the weekends (usually a couple multi-hour runs) which would reduce my weight heading into the work week. I would then catch back up on my weight when I was busy with classes, before losing momentum again over the weekend. My dad\\u2019s better performance on the weekends is likely also due to an increase in exercise when he was not in work. These results say I need to work on consuming more food on the weekends, and my dad needs to work on reducing his consumption during the week. A generalized additive model may seem complex, but we can use the results to determine simple actions to improve our health! A further benefit of modeling is that we can use the results to make predictions. We can make predictions with either the linear model or the generalized additive model, but because the additive model better represents the data, we will only make predictions with it. There are two estimates that are of primary interest: The first prediction will allow us to compare our performance in the second half of the competition from that predicted based on our first half data. The second prediction will give us an idea of where we expect to be one year from now. An essential aspect of predictions that is often overlooked are the uncertainty bounds. Managers usually only want a single number for a forecast, but that is an impossibility in an uncertain world. Even the most accurate model is not able to capture inherent randomness in the data or non-exact measuring devices. Therefore in order to be responsible data scientists, we will provide a range of uncertainty in addition to a single prediction number. The following graphs show the predictions for Craig and me for the planned end of the competition made from data up to November 1, 2017. The gray shaded region indicates that most crucial part of an forecast: the region of uncertainty. The red line shows us the most likely future results were we to continue exactly on the trend observed so far. The shaded region is the likely range of finishing weights based on the observations and taking into account the noise in the measurements. To put those ranges in perspective, we should look at the actual numbers: The actual weight for both my dad and I fell into the range predicted. The model did a relatively good job of predicting our actual weights two months in advance considering it was working on about 70 datapoints! As a final exploration of the models, we can look at where we can expect to be one year from now. Perhaps these prediction will not quite turn out , but they should at least give us a goal for the next year! Following are predictions for 2019 made using all the competition data: These graphs clearly show how uncertainty increases the further out we extrapolate from data. According to these plots, I could weigh more than my dad at the beginning of next year! This exercise is meant to be more for fun than as a serious prediction, but the forecast can improve if we continue to collect more data. Eventually, with enough information, we should be able to build a model that could theoretically make accurate predictions one year into the future. We\\u2019ll have to check back in next year for an update on the accuracy of these predictions! The question to ask yourself at the end of any data analysis is: \\u201cWhat do I know now that I can use?\\u201d Sometimes the answer will be not much and that is perfectly fine! It simply indicates you need to collect more data or you need to rethink the modeling approach. However, in the analysis of the Great Weight Challenge of 2017, there are some insights to review and put into use! Finally, I will show two more plots which contrast the predictions for Jan 1, 2018 with the actual results on this date. I hope this post has shown how anyone can use data science in their daily life for personal or community benefit. My goal is to democratize data science and allow everyone to take advantage of this exciting field by demonstrating real uses of data science tools! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached at wjk68@case.edu. Cleaning the Cleveland Open Street Map Author\\u2019s Note: The following exploratory data analysis project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree that I finished in May 2017. All of the code can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an project-centered format. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is an open-source project attempting to created a free map of the entire world from volunteer-entered data. It is maintained by the OpenStreetMap foundation and is a colloborative effort with over 2 million contributors. OpenStreetMap data is freely available to download in many formats and presents an ideal opportunity to practice the art of data wrangling for several reasons: I decided to work with the metro area of Cleveland because it is where I currently attend university (at Case Western Reserve University), and I thought it would be intriguing to explore the city through the dataset after many hours spent experiencing the city on the ground. The data extract of Cleveland used for this project was downloaded from Mapzen Metro Extracts. The first step was to download the map as an XML file. The original file clocked in at nearly 5.5 million lines, which was somewhat unwieldy for testing the first versions of auditing and cleaning scripts. Consequently, I decided to create smaller sample XML files for the first runs of the auditing scripts and for identifying the most common problems that would need to be cleaned. Using a provisional sampling script, I created a small file that contained one out of every 100 top-level element, and an intermediate size script that kept one out of 10 top-level elements. There are three core, top-level elements in OSM: Sample of OSM data as XML: The breakdown of top-level elements for the three file sizes is summarized in the following table: Data Auditing and Cleaning Approach Being in control of a large dataset can be both exciting and intimidating! There are numerous possiblities for exploration, but the sheer amount of information can be overwhelming. Before I officially began any data wrangling, I wanted to have a step-by-step plan in order to efficiently go through the process of auditing and cleaning the data. I decided on the following approach, adapted from the Udacity course on Data Wrangling: 3. Implement the data cleaning plan: run cleaning scripts and transfer the cleaned data to .csv files 4. Manually correct as necessary: import the data from .csv files to a SQL database and perform SQL queries on the data to identify any further inconsistencies that would necessitate returning to step 1. Data wrangling is an iterative procedure, and as such, I expected that I might need to work through these steps several times. Moreover, I knew that having a clear outline of the procedure to follow would save me untold hours of work and confusion. Data Quality There are five main aspects of data quality to consider when auditing a dataset: Elevation Looking at the official documentation for elevation data in OpenStreetMap, elevation in tags should be recorded in meters. Furthermore, from the United States Geological Survey list of elevation of major cities, I can see that the elevation of Cleveland ranges from 571' at the lowest point to 1050' at the highest point. Therefore, after converting to meters, all elevation data encoded in node tags should be between 174 m and 320 m. This would be a test for both uniformity, because all elevation data should use the same units, and accuracy as I was checking the elevations against a trusted source. The following code was used to find elevation points outside of the acceptable range and invalid elevations: The audit identified any elevations above or below those measures, as well as any elevations that could not be cast to an integer. I could have used regular expressions to identify problematic characters, but since I expected all the elevations to be integers, the simpler approach was to attempt to cast all the elevation data to integers. This initial effort yielded 2516 suspect elevations and 5 problem elevations in the entire dataset. I decided that assuming all the elevations above or below the accepted limits were false was a mistake. The USGS data was for the city of Cleveland itself, and my map included surrounding areas. Therefore, I took a closer look at the suspect elevations. The four highest values were [1188, 423, 419, 414] and the four lowest were [3, 3, 42, 321]. I decided that 423 m was a reasonable elevation for the surrounding area of Cleveland. However, clearly the 1188 was meant to be in feet, and the three lowest points were not realistic. I made the choice to eliminate the three lowest elevation tags and convert the largest value to meters. The elevations with bad characters were [\\u2018318;313\\u2019, \\u2018304.5\\u2019, \\u2018298.4\\u2019, \\u2018679\\\"\\u2019, \\u2018348;352;358\\u2019]. I decided to take the first elevation listed if there were multiple entries and convert the entry in feet to meters. Total, this meant I only had to correct 9 problem elevations out of 6500. That makes me confident that the accuracy and uniformity of the dataset was initially very high. The actual cleaning of the elevation data would take place when I converted the XML into CSV files. I created a mapping for correcting the elevations and implemented it in the following code: The result of running the code on the problem elevations is: Amenities The amenity tags associated with way elements was one facet of the data I could audit for validity, or conformation to a schema. The OpenStreetMap wiki has a page on the amenity key. This webpage shows all of the accepted amenities in OpenStreetMap and gives the purpose of the amenity tag: \\u201cTo cover an assortment of community facilities including toilets, telephones, banks, pharmacies and schools.\\u201d I wanted to check if all the amenities tags in the Cleveland dataset were among the officially validated tags from OpenStreetMap. To do so, I downloaded the source of the webpage as XML and extracted all of the amentities from the table using the python XML module. I then compared the amentities in the Cleveland OpenStreetMap XML file to this set using the following code: I did not necessarily want to delete the amentities that could not be validated, but rather, I would reclassify them into the amenity categories already part of OpenStreetMap. The non-verified amentities and the number of times they occured in the dataset are presented below: As can be seen, none of the non-verified amenities occured more than once. Furthermore, several of the amenities were not in agreement with the purpose of the tag from the documentation and would be better placed under tags such as \\u201cleisure.\\u201d Therefore, I concluded that it would be best to reclassify the amenities that could not be verified according to the official dichotomy rather than modify the official list. I created a mapping based on the official description of the amenities and my judgement and applied it when converting the XML data to CSV files. Street Types Another variable I could could audit for validity and consistency was the street names associated with the node and way tag. From my initial exploratory examination of the data, I had noticed a wide variety in street name endings and abbreviations. Using a provisional street name auditing script, I compared the street endings to a standardized list and counted the number of times each non-standard type appeared using the following function: That produced the following dictionary listing the non-standard street names and the number of occurences: In order to standardize the street names, I created a mapping and applied it to the data during the conversion from XML to CSV files: The street mapping produces the following output: Postal Codes An additional audit I could perform for accuracy was on the postal codes (also known as ZIP codes in the United States for Zone Improvement Plan). My approach with the postal codes was to find a complete and trusted list of all the postal codes in the area I had downloaded, and then compare those to the postal codes in the OpenStreetMap file. The first step was to find all the postal codes. I initially searched for Cleveland zip codes and found the United States Postal Service data for postal codes in Cleveland. However, after finding that an alarmingly large percentage of the post codes in the XML file were not in this list, I realized that the area I had downloaded was a square and did not conform to the administrative boundaries of the city of Cleveland. My next approach was to examine the XML I had downloaded and find the latitude and longitude boudaries of the square. Then, using the FreeMapTools post code finding tool, I was able to draw the exact box on a map and extract all the zip codes within the specified box. This yielded me 276 zip codes. I then compared the zip codes within the XML data to this set and extracted those that did not match as well as any problem zip codes such as {\\u201844256:44321\\u2019} or \\u2018OH 44312\\u2019 which could not be converted to an integer. For the problem zip codes, if there were multiple codes separated by a colon, I took the first code as long as it was in the official list. For the zip codes outside of the geographic area, I decided to remove the tag entirely. The following code was used to perform the audit: After performing the audit, I had 41 postcodes outside of the boundary box and 242 zip codes that included multiple codes and/or a leading state abbreviation. The following code was used to perform the actual cleaning of the zip codes: Consistent Dates The last crucial issue I observed in my audit of the data was inconsistent date formatting. All the timestamps automatically made when a user makes an edit of the OpenStreetMap are recorded as: timestamp=\\u201d2009\\u201305\\u201321T03:59:40Z\\u201d. However, some of the dates under the secondary elements were in other formats such as \\u201c06/05/2006\\u201d. Dates in this form can be intrepreted ambiguously, and I wanted all dates to be recorded in a consistent format so they could be more procssed and clearly understood in any data analysis performed on the set. In the entire Cleveland XML source data, there were 16320 dates in the non-standard (except for in the United States) MM/DD/YEAR format. Below is the code for the audit: Looking through the documentation for OpenStreetMap concerning dates, I found the following statement: \\u201cThere is no standing recommendation as to the date format to be used. However, the international standard ISO 8601 appears to be followed by 9 of the top 10 values for this tag. The ISO 8601 basic date format is YYYY-MM-DD.\\u201d Based on this information, I decided to adopt the ISO 8601 format for dates. The cleaning function to convert dates from MM/DD/YEAR to YEAR-MM-DD is below: The first round of the cleaning procedure was executed when the Cleveland OSM data was converted from the original source XML file to eight different CSV files. Moreover, in the conversion process, the data was validated against a predefined schema.py file to ensure that both the structure of the csv files and the types of the data entered were as expected. This procedure was susccessfully completed after several tries and some reworking of the cleaning and converting scripts. However even though the data had been transferred, I expected that in the process of creating and exploring the SQL database, I would find more \\u201cdirty\\u201d data that I would need to correct. I was well aware that data wrangling is an iterative procedure, and consequently was ready to work through the steps of the process again as needed. My next step was to initialize a SQL (Standard Query Langauge) database and to create the tables within based on a pre-defined schema. I also created additional tables for the relation data using the following schema. The schema was designed to adhere to the components of database normalization and to allow for cross-referencing and joining of the data within the tables: I then imported the data from the eight CSV files into the eight corresponding SQL tables. I encountered a few issues along the way, mainly with the type of data in the CSV files not matching the type I had assigned to the columns of the table including user names that were completely integers. I manually resolved most of these issues and made a few alterations to the CSV files to ensure that all the data types matched what SQL expected. After successfully importing all the data into the tables, it was time to start the most rewarding phase of the project, investigating the data! I formulated a few questions to guide my exploration of the dataset: Answering these questions inenvitably led me down many different paths. I found the dataset very interesting, and was constantly making queries to answer new questions that arose. I used SQLite3 from the command line to create the tables and execute queries and I also ran some queries within the Jupyter Notebook. First, a few simple queries to find out how much data about Cleveland I had. The results are summarized below: Contributors to the Cleveland OpenStreetMap The breakdown of users who contributed to the map was the most intriguing topic to me. Again, I expected a samll handful of users (maybe bots) to dominate the edits. Sure enough, the very first entry has bot in the name! Looking through the users on OpenStreetMap, it does appear that \\u201cwoodpeck-fixbot\\u201d is an automated account created by a longtime contributor to OSM. Examining some of the other top editors, it appears that at least some of them are automated as well. In order to delve further into the data, I wanted to look at the percentages of total edits contributed by the top few accounts. Looking at the statistics for contributing users shows a massive descrepancy among number of edits. The mean number of edits is 1529, a figure that is clearly skewed by the few super-users at the top. Meanwhile, the median number of edits is only 16. Next, I found the total number of unique users. There are a total of 1988723 edits across the dataset. This means that the top user, \\u201cwoodpeck-fixbot,\\u201d alone contributed 29.62% of the map! Furthermore, the top 10 users contributed 62.56% of all edits. The remaining 1290 users made less than 40% of the edits. Let\\u2019s put that in graphical form. First write the query to find the top 10 contributors by number of edits: Graph the edits by top 10 contributors: Graph the top 10 users contributions as fraction of total contributions: To put the discrepancy into even starker terms, the number of users who made only a single edit can be found. Clearly, the Cleveland OpenStreetMap is dominated by a few users while the vast majority of editors make only a few contributions. Nonetheless, on the positive side, 1300 people have contributed to the map, which demonstrates the wide interest in contributing to open-source community driven projects. Leisure and Amentities What sorts of leisure activites might one find in the great city of Cleveland? Well, using the SQL database, that question could be quickly answered. I have to admit I was somewhat confused by the pitch identifier. However, a quick glance at the OpenStreetMap wiki for pitch reveals that the keyword pitch is for \\u201can area designed for playing a particular sport, normally designated with appropriate markings. Examples include: tennis court, basketball court, ball park, riding arena.\\u201d That makes much more sense. Now, I can see what types of sports those pitches are used for: I would have expected basketball and American football to come out on top, but if each separate field or court is counted, then these numbers would be accurate. Next, I wanted to see the available amenities in Cleveland: Having lived in Cleveland for several years, I can personally tell you that even with all of that parking, it can be hard to find a parking place downtown! Just for fun, I wanted to find out the most popular types of cuisine in Cleveland: Finally, because Cleveland is a city known for its river (not a day goes by when someone does not mention to me that the Cuyahoga River is famous for catching on fire, although I am always quick to add not since the 1970s) I investigated the waterways. Those numbers seem a little high. I think what is occuring is that the same waterway is being tagged multiple times but in different places. I decided to group the waterways by name and then find how many times each waterway name appeared in the data: That looks a little more realistic. The famous Cuyahoga River does not even make it into the top 5 waterway mentions on the map. GNIS (Geographic Names Information System) and TIGER (Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing) Data Finally, I was interested to see where or even if users were sourcing their data from when were entering it onto the map. Looking through the CSV files, I had noticed that many tags were either GNIS or TIGER types. A quick search revealed that GNIS stands for the Geographic Names Information System, created by the USGS. It is a database that contains over 2 million cultural and physical features in the United States. Many of the node tags and way tags appeared to reference from this database. The TIGER tag refers to the Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing database from the US Census Bureau that includes features such as roads and rivers. These tags were applied to primarily the relations and also some of the ways. I wanted to see what percentage of each of the tags for nodes, ways, and relations were tied to either the GNIS or TIGER databases. These statistics appear to be reasonable. The nodes for the most part are single points, and as such, do not have to be tied to a particular physical feature. The ways on the other hand, are composed of numerous nodes and often describe a route such as a highway or a trail that would be more likely to be found in a database. The relations usually describe a building or maybe a certain type of restriction such as no-left turn. Those would be less likely to be documented in a geographic database. Of course, there could be other databases besides GNIS and TIGER that I did not investigate, but this shows that a substantial portion of the ways in the Cleveland OSM data are based on verified features. What is Cleveland city planners\\u2019 favorite type of restriction? Average number of nodes in a way: Average number of members in a relation: Max number of tags assigned to one node: Additional Ideas for Analysis After observing the percentage of nodes, ways, and relations that have at least partially reference from a verified database, one potential idea to implement for the data would be to try and validate as many of the elements as is feasible. It should be possible to create a script that would read the XML file, and for each element, find the name tag of the feature and attempt to corroborate the information with an established database, whether that be GNIS, TIGER, or another option. For example, searching for \\u201cDoan Brook\\u201d in the GNIS database returns the following entry: This information could then be compared with the tags associated with \\u201cDoan Brook\\u201d in the OpenStreetMap and any incorrect user-entered information could be replaced with the validated data. This would be quite an undertaking for all of the elements in the original data, but it would vastly improve the quality of the data and reference it to a trusted source. The most intriguing aspect of the dataset to me was the skew in the percentage of edits made by users. I think it would be interesting to compare the quality of the data entered by bots compared to the quality of the data entered by users. Although bots should theoretically not make as many mistakes, they are programmed by humans, and an incorrectly designed bot could end up generating a large amount of \\u201cdirty\\u201d data with the creator never even realizing it. Humans users on the other hand, are slower but could potentially be more accurate and descriptive. Humans also have the advantage of being better able to judge the category a given feature should fall into and what tags should be associated with an element. Perhaps the best approach would be for bots to label the more straightforward features, such as nodes, and then have humans add in the details such as tags and descriptions that accurately model how the feature is used or experienced in the real world. These maps would not be possible to create in such detail without automated bots, but they occasionally need audits to ensure that the automated programs are not executing unintended actions. Moreover, humans are able to add nuanced data that even the most carefully programmed bot would never be able to figure out without having physically experienced the land being mapped. Overall, I was surprised by the quality of the original dataset. There was far less invalid, inaccurate, or problematic data than I was expecting. To take a single example, I only had to correct 9 problem elevations out of nearly 6500 elevation tags in the data. OpenStreetMap seems to be an accurate model of the actual world, as shown by at least one study. The quality of any open-source project is directly dependent on the users, and it is clear that the OpenStreetMap users care deeply about ensuring that the map they have collectively created is complete and accurate. Similar to how a community of users were able to create an online encyclopedia, Wikipedia, that is nearly as accurate as professionally produced encyclopedias, the OpenStreetMap community has generated a remarkably accurate map of the world. Judging the completeness of the data is difficult without going through the city feature by feature and ensuring that it is accounted for in the OSM. However, I think that as a metro area, Cleveland would tend to be more complete than rural areas. I would expect that larger cities have more complete and accurate datasets because of the higher concentration of users to enter data. I would imagine that the real challenge for the OpenStreetMap community is creating accurate maps of rural communities that have decreased access to data and a wide user base willing to update a map. Perhaps this is why bots could be of greatest use. They could use GPS data or satellite pictures, perhaps coupled with machine learning, to identify different geographical and architectural features that could then be validated by a human user. This project was a great exercise in data auditing, cleaning, and analysis as well as the basics of creating and interacting with a SQL database. The next steps would be to actually implement the data cleaning by running the scripts on entire sections of the OSM data and then updating the map itself. OpenStreetMap is very consciously aware of checking and improving the quality of the mapand using automated tools, it should be possible to further improve on the relatively high quality of the Cleveland OpenStreetMap. Examining the Doctor\\u2019s Appointment No-Show Dataset Author\\u2019s Note: The following exploratory data analysis project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree that I finished in May 2017. All code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an applied setting. This version of the Exploratory Data Analysis project has all the code removed for readability. The version with all the R code included is also on Medium. Doctor\\u2019s appointment no-shows are a serious issue in the public health care field. Missed appointments are associated with poorer patient outcomes and cost the health care system in the US nearly $200 each. Therefore, it comes as no small surprise that reducing the rate of no-shows has become a priority in the United States and around the world. Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to determine the most effective means of\\nreducing rates of absenteeism at with varying degrees of success. The first step to solving the problem of missed appointments is identifying why a patient skips a scheduled visit in the first place. What trends are there among patients with higher absence rates? Are there demographic indicators or perhaps time-variant relationships hiding in the data? Ultimately, it was these questions that drove my exploratory data analysis. I was curious as to the reasons behind missed appointments, and wanted to examine the data to identify any trends present. I choose this problem because I believe it is an excellent example of how data science and analysis can reveal relationships which can be implemented in the real-world to the benefit of society. I wanted to choose a dataset that was both relatable and could be used to make smarter decisions. Therefore, I decided to work with medical appointment no shows data available on Kaggle. This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit. There were a total of 14 variables I included from the original data. The variables and the description of the values are as follows Let\\u2019s take a look at the structure of the dataframe to identify cleaning/organizing that may need to be performed. From the structure of the dataframe, I can see there is some data housekeeping that needs to be done. First, I want to change the Status variable into an integer 0 or 1. A value of 1 will indicate that the patient did not show up as I am concerned with the variables that are most strongly correlated with a missed appointment. Moreover, I need to convert the registration date and the appointment date to date objects. I decided not to maintain the time (hours:minutes:seconds) associated with the registration date for the appointment although it was available (time of day was not available for the appointment date). I converted both the appointment registration date and appointment date to date objects so I could investigate seasonal and time patterns in the data. Based on the updated structure of the dataframe, it looks like I am on the right track but I still have a couple more modifications to make to the dataframe. I will create month, year, and day fields for the appointment and also rename the columns to a more consistent and readable format. That should about do it for the structure of the main dataframe. I am also concerned with missing/corrupted data, so I will look at the summary of each field to see if any obvious errors or outliers are present in the data. The summary of the no_shows dataframe reveals plenty of intriguing information as well as several errors that need to be corrected. Right away, it is clear that an age of -2 is not correct, and 113 is stretching the boundaries. However, looking at the oldest people in the world, it is plausible that 113 could be a correct age. I will filter out any negative ages and create a histogram of ages to see if there are a significant amount of outliers at the upper end. Moreover, this data summary shows that 30.24% of appointments are missed based on the mean for the status field. The rates for the various patient conditions can also be seen, and the most commonly coded reason for an appointment is hypertension at nearly 22% of visits. Also, the weekends appear to be a very unpopular time for doctor\\u2019s appointments in Brazil, or perhaps the clinics from which this data was drawn are not open on the weekend. Either way, I will need to keep the small sample size of appointments on the weekend in mind when I perform an analysis by weekday. Frequency Distribution of Ages The age histogram does not aligh exactly with my intutions though it is close. I expected that it would be bi-modal, with peaks in patient count at the youngest ages and at the oldest ages. However, while the largest number of patients do appear to be the youngest, the number of patients remains fairly constant into the middle ages, with a second peak around age 60 and then a steep decline into the oldest ages. Based on the visualization, there do not appear to be a large number of outliers in the upper range of the ages. I was skeptical of the high proportion of visits from those aged 0 and decided I needed to do some research. Based on the description of the dataset, this data is for primary care physicians in the public sector and so I looked for a breakdown of ages of patients at these appointments. I could not find statistics from Brazil, but based on official statistics from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, children under 1 year of age make up 2.6% of all physician visits. I can create a better plot showing the percentage each age is of all patients. I can also quickly check the percentage of visits comprised of patients aged 0 in the data. Percentage of patients with an age of 0:\\n3.442069% The calculation shows that 0-year olds make up 3.44% of visits. While the initial frequency distribution may looked skewed, the spread of the data along the years makes it look like 0-year olds make up considerably more of the visits than is actually the case. The corrected bar plot does a better job of representing the proportion of patients from each age. From the research by the CDC and the visualization, I conclude that the age distribution skew is not bad but rather legitimate data. To check for outliers in the waiting time field (or how long between the date the appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment), I will make another histogram. Based on the summary statistics of the dataframe, the longest waiting time was 398 days, with a median of 8 days, and a mean of 13.84 days. From the histogram and the statistics, it is clear that there are a small number of patients at the upper end of the distribution who schedule their appointment very far in advance. I wonder if the 398 days is accidentally a mistake that occured when someone choose the wrong year for their appointment! The graph is certainly long-tailed and positively skewed with a few extreme outliers at the upper limit. Number of patients with wait time longer than one year:\\n1\\nNumber of patients with wait time longer than six months:\\n136 It appears there is only one patient with a waiting time over one year and just over 100 (out of 300000) with a waiting time of over six months. I will exclude the patient with the waiting time over one year, but I will treat the others as good but extreme data. Here is a version of the histogram that better represents the wait time for most patients. As can be seen in the chart, a plurality of patients wait less than 10 days between the scheduling and the date of their appointment. Based on these visualizations, and the summary statistics for the dataframe, I am confident that the data content of the main dataframe is valid. I can now start the exploration phase of exploratory data analysis! It is time to discover the relationships, or lack thereof, between the variables in the data. The first step I can take is to find the correlations between all of the columns to see if any stand out as particularly compelling. Of course, I expect that all the trends will not reveal themselves straight away. The rcorr function from the Hmisc library will calculate the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coeffient between every field of a dataframe. The Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of how linearly dependent two variables on each other. The coefficient value is between -1 and +1, and two variables that are perfectly linearly correlated will have a value of +1. From those correlation values, there are no standouts that are strong linear predictors of whether or not a patient will miss a visit (given by the status column). It appears that there are not even any strong relationships whatsoever though there is a moderate relationship between age and hypertension. However, I still think there are meaningful relationships to extract from the data. My approach will be to group the data by various fields and then determine if the average absence rate shows a relationship with the fields. The first group of variables I will look at will be those associated with the time-variability of the appointment date. Date of Appointment To start off the time-series analysis, I will want to look at absence rate by month of the year. I first needed to group the appointments by month of year and then find the average absence rate for each month. From the graph and the correlation coefficient, it appears there is a minor relationship between month of the year and absence rate. Missed visits do appear to rise as the year progresses, but with only 12 data points, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient is quite large (-0.05 to 0.85). I would expect that during the end of the year, people tend to be busier and may miss more appointments. It could also be possible that at the beginning of the year, individuals make resolutions to see the doctor and keep a higher percentage of appointments, but the trend could also be noise. Next, I will create a similar absence rate over time graph, but this time by day of the month. Looking at the plot we can see that there is a very slight positive correlation between day of the month and absence rate but again, the 95% confidence interval spans a wide range of values. To further explore any time variability in the data, I can create the same graph by day of the year and broken out by gender. Mean absence rate for males:\\n30.99653%\\nMean absence rate for females\\n29.86962% From these charts, it appears looks as if there is no correlation betwen the time of year and the absence rate for appointments. Moreover, adding in the gender does not reveal any major descrepancies, although from the calculation, we can see that men on average have a 1% higher absence rate. There are several days for which the absence rate is 1, which bears some more investigation. My idea is that these points might corespond to public holidays. However, I also see that these days are not consistent across the two years, so maybe there are other major events that correspond to an increase in absences. I decided to overlay the holidays to see if that might reveal a relationship. I sourced the holidays based on public holidays in Brazil for each respective year. Again, it seems as if these holidays do not line up with higher rates of missed appointments. There is a sustained increase in the absence rate around the beginning of July, but it does not seem to correspond to any holidays. I researched festivals in Brazil in June-July 2015, and it appears that the Paraty International Literary Festival occured July 1\\u20135, but I doubt that this explains the absence rate. There was not city data associated with the original dataset, so it is difficult to attempt to cross-reference specific dates with specific events.\\nI will create a simliar graph for 2014. I remember that the 2014 soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, so perhaps the time around the world cup will have a higher absence rate. I will plot a few holidays and then the dates surrounding the World Cup (which lasted for a month). Perhaps there is a slight increase in absence rate during the World Cup? The graph does not clearly indicate either was but I can compare the average absence rate during the World Cup to the average absence rate over the entire length of 2014.Mean absence rate during all of 2014\\\\ [1] 30.08656\\nMean absence rate during 2014 World Cup\\n[1] 30.79473 There is a small but not significant increase in the absence rate during the World Cup. It looks like in terms of time variability, there is no significant correlation based on the day of the year or the day of the month. There is one more time variation I want to look at, and that is day of the week. To remind myself of the small sample sizes on the weekend, I also show the appointment days of the week count. Finally, it looks like there might be some time variability in this data when it is broken down by weekday. Excluding Saturday and Sunday because of their small sample sizes, Monday and Friday have the highest absence rate and Tuesday has the lowest. I will alter the plot to show the absence rate as a relative percentage change from the overall mean absence rate. Based on this chart, patients are 6% more likely to miss an appointment on a Monday compared to the overall average absence rate, and 4% less likely to miss an appointment on a Tuesday. This is an actionable discovery for both patients and doctors! If patients want to keep their appointments, and if doctors want to make sure their patients show up, they should schedule their appointments during the middle three days of the week. Patient Age I wanted to move on from the time variability and look at the demographic data. In particular, I am interested in whether or not age is correlated with absence rate. My initial guess would be that the youngest and the oldest patients would tend to have lower absence rates. Meanwhile, those patients in the middle would generally be healthier and thus would feel more inclined to skip an appointment. (Everyone is convinced they are invincible in their 20s. In fact, this was one of the issues associated with the initial rollout of Obamacare. Too many young, healthy individuals did not believe they needed insurance and therefore did not sign up for healthcare.) First I will group patients by age and then visualize the average absence rates. The chart reveals the possibility of a negative relationship between age and absence rate. First though, it is clear that the outliers in the upper end of the data introduce substantial variance. As there are only 719 patients over 90 out of 300000 entries, I think I can filter out any ages over 90 without impacting the validating of the data while reducing the noise. I will use that filter and then improve the aesthetics of the graph. We can observe that the youngest ages have a relatively low absence rate with an exception for 1-year-olds. The absence rate then climbs for teenagers, peaking around age 20, before beginning a long, gradual decline to around 70, at which point the absence rate rises again slightly. I would like to know precisely which ages have the highest and lowest absence rates. Moreover, what is the pearson correlation between age and absence rate? Maximum absence rate of 40.21% occurs at age 18\\nMinimum absence rate of 20.25% occurs at age 72 Here are more actionable conclusions. Public health officials need to work on getting teenagers to show up to their appointments! This is expecially crucial because studies have shown that habits form very early and are hard to change later in life. A trend of going to the doctor while younger will likely persist as a patient ages and lead to better lifelong health. We can further bin the data in five years increments to highlight the \\u201cproblem years\\u201d, that is, the years with the highest missed appointment rate. I will plot the relative absence rate, or the average age group absence rate as a percentage relative to the average absence rate for all ages. Remember, in this plot, below the x-axis is better because it indicates that the age group has a lower rate of missed appointments than the average. Based on the chart, is it clear that the worst group in terms of absence rate is 15\\u201320 year-olds and the best group for attedance is 70\\u201375 year-olds. The visualization and the statistics are definitive when it comes to ages and missed appointments. The correlation between ages and absence rate is -0.86, which is strongly negative and indicates that as the age of the patient increases, statistically, that patient is less likely to miss a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. Waiting Time After finding a strong relationship between age and absence rate, I will move on to examine other variables. I would like to search for a possible trend in absence rate by waiting time, or the time between when an appointment was scheduled, and when the appointment took place. My hypothesis is that patients with a longer waiting time will have a higher missed appointment rate because their condition has more time to change in the interim period. Moreover, I think that patients with a shorter waiting time are more likely to need urgent care or have a problem they deem to be pressing, and it would certainly be in their best interest to show up at the appointment. The graph and the correlation coefficient seem to demonstrate a lack of any relationship. However, thinking back on the histogram of waiting time from the initial exploration, the majority of the patients waited under 100 days. There are far fewer data points from people waiting more than 100 days, which is why the average absence rate for those times tends to be either 0% or 100%. If I limit the data to people with a waiting time less than 3 months (90 days), might there exist a relationship? Furthermore, I will group the data into 10 day segments. Patients with a waiting time over 90 days\\n1646 If the data is limited to those patients who scheduled fewer than 3 months in advance, there is a slight positive correlation between waiting time and absence rate. I tried to do some research on this subject in general, and found this from the Safety Net Dental Clinic: \\u201cExperience in many safety net dental programs also suggests that the incidence of broken appointments increases when appointments are scheduled more than three weeks in advance.\\u201d Based on my analysis, I concur. Patients who schedule less than 10 days out are 20% less likely to miss an appointment than those scheduling further out. The Safety Net Dental Clinic page mentions that often other life events get in the way when we schedule too far out, and although that may be a slightly different situation, the general pattern appears to hold in this case. Add a point to schedule as few days out as possible to the list of recommendations for patients looking to adhere to a scheduled appointment. SMS Reminders One of the most intriguing aspects of the dataset to me was the SMS (Short Message Service) text message reminder counts. Text message reminders have been implemented in many clinics because of their ease of use and low cost. Moreover, they have been shown to be effective in some situations. I want to examine this data to discover how or if SMS messages correlate with a failure to attend. I would think that patients who recieve SMS messages will be more likely to attend the appointment than those not receiving them. However, this could be complicated by the fact that younger patients are more likely to sign up for text message alerts, and as we have already seen, young individuals are more inclined to be record a no-show. Therefore, I will probably need to further look at who exactly is recieving the text messages in addition to the correlation between text messages and attendance at the appointment. The graph is somewhat surprising to me; one text message seems to decrease the absence rate while two increases the absence rate significantly. I would have expected more SMS reminders to be strongly correlated with a decrease in absence rate. Maybe the direction of this relationship is the opposite of what I thought. Instead of SMS messages persuading patients to attend a scheduled appointment, patients who are least likely to attend an appointment receive more text messages. One way to check for this would be to look at average SMS messages per appointment received by age. I expect there might be odd behavior at the ends of this graph (how young do children receive their first phone nowadays? Has the average 80-year old embraced text messages?). I expect that segmenting by age might reveal more nuances than the overall absence rate vs text messages. Sure enough, the average number of SMS reminders per appointment is greater among the younger ages. I looked through the data provider information, and I could not ascertain whether or not those SMS reminders were to the parent in the case of a very young child but that seems likely. From the statistics and the plot, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of SMS messages and the age of the patient. To further explore the absence rate vs text message, I will recreate the absence rate vs age graph, but this time, create separate curves for number of SMS reminders received. Looking at the graph, we can see that the absence rate versus age grouped by number of SMS reminders looks much the same for the 0 or 1 reminders. However, the graph for 2 reminders is much noisier. I suspect that is due to the lower sample size of people receiving two reminders (which was the maximum). In order to determine if there is an effect from text message reminders at a given age, I need to create a plot showing the difference in absence rates at each age between those receiving any reminder and those receiving no reminder. Indeed, it does appears that at a given age, the absence rate decreases with 1 or 2 text messages reminders. In fact, the average difference in absence rate holding age constant is -0.57%. That means that having receiving an SMS reminder at a given age decreases the chance that a patient will miss a scheduled appointment by 0.6%. This may seem small, but it could add up over millions of appointments. Moreover, there are certain ages when the effect of the SMS reminders is much greater. The reduction in missed appointments is as great as 2% at age ten and near 3% during other years. This reduction in the failure to attend rate is also what research into text message reminders has found. One study,conducted in Brazil, found: \\u201cThe nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p = .590), 3.55% (p = .009), 5.75% (p = .022), and 14.49% (p = <.001).\\u201d Furthermore, the conclusion of this research was: \\u201cThe study results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients\\u2019 cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving uninterrupted care benefit.\\u201d Based on my analysis of the data, I must concur that at a given age, SMS reminders decrease the absence rate. Another valuable piece of information that could be quite easily implemented in the real world to improve outcomes! Patient Markers The final step in this exploratory analysis is to look at the absence rate by the condition for which the patient visited the doctor. I will group by the markers in the original data and then look at each average absence rate. There are considerable differences illustrated between those with different markers. Tuberculosis has the highest rate of absence, followed by alcoholism. However, these conditions also make up a small sample of the overall visits. Diabetes and hypertension have the lowest absence rate. Interestingly, patients marked as being part of the Bolsa Familia welfare program have a high rate of absences. This program rewards patients for attending appointments, which should induce patients to visit their doctor more often. Perhaps there are other factors at play here though. It could be that families on the welfare program cannot take the time to visit the doctor because of the opportunity cost of not working. To put the conditions in perspective, here is the percentage of all visits each condition makes up. The final plot I can make is of the conditions and the relative percentage difference in absence rates compared to the mean absence rate. Relative difference plots are helpful to me because it is possible to quickly identify if one variable is above or below the average. Again, for this particular plot, values below the x-axis are great because it means the absence rate is lower than the overall average. The differences between conditions here are stark. Again, the smaller sample sizes associated with alcoholism and tuberculosis must be taken into account, but it is clear that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to attend an appointment. In fact, they are more than 15% less likely to miss an appointment then the average patient. This is an interesting result and I wonder if it is because of the constant need for care when treating both of these conditions. However, it would seem like all of the conditions require care on an ongoing basis. I would need more detailed condition information before I drew any conclusions about possible causes of the absence rates broken out by condition. I started this project off with a single simple question: what factors are most likely to determine whether or not a patient shows up to their scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment? As the exploratory data analysis went on, I found this one question had branched into dozens. Does the number of SMS reminders correlate with absence rates? How about if we compare SMS reminders for a given age? Are there major variabilities that we can observe associated with holidays? I found my curiousity and interest in the dataset only grew as I delved further and further. Although at first it appeared there were few meaningful relationships, by grouping and segmenting the data, clear trends emerged. Keeping in mind that this dataset may not be representative of all countries and health care systems, the following are the most notable discoveries from the patient no-show data: 2. There is a slight positive correlation between absence rate and the day of the month and as the month progresses, the percentage of missed appointments rises moderately. 3. There is no correlation in the absence rate over the days of the year. 4. Excluding the weekends, the day of the week with the highest absence rate is Monday followed by Friday. Tuesday had the lowest rate of absences with appointments on Tuesday 4% more likely to be attended than those on the other days of the week. 5. The age of patients was demonstrated a strong negative linear correlation with absence rates with a correlation coefficient of -0.86. 6. There was a slight positive correlation between the rate of missed appointments and how many days in advance the patient scheduled the appointment. 7. When looking at the dataset as a whole, patients who recieved two SMS reminders were more likely to miss an appointment than those who recieved no reminders. However, the correlation between age and average text messages recieved was -0.80 meaning that younger patients, who were more likely to miss appointments overall, received more text messages. Subsequently, the effect of text messages reminders can only be revealed by looking at messages received at a given age. 8. Patients whose appointments were marked for tuberculosis and alcoholism were the most likely to miss the visit, while those coded for hypertension and diabetes were the least likely to miss their appointment. These are but a few briefs observations that can be gleaned from this dataset. Keeping in mind that correlations do not imply causations (more serious link for those interested), and that some of the groupings results in small sample sizes, there are actionable items that with appropriate further study, could be implemented in the health care system. The final aspect of the project was to revisit and refine three of my earlier plots. Primarily I am concerned with whether or not the visualizations correctly convey the information within the dataset. My secondary objective is of course aesthetics because what good is even the most informative chart if it is not presentable? Absence Rate vs. Day of the Year This first chart was notable to me because of the lack of relationships it revealed. It is the graph of absence rate versus day of the year in 2014 with holidays (and the World Cup) included. I would have initially believed that absence rates spiked around holidays and near the end of the year. However, no clear trend emerged from this plot. In order to improve the information content and the aesthetics, I altered some of the colors, changed the scale on the axis, added in the mean absence rate for reference, and made sure all labels were accurate. The conclusion to draw from this visualization is that there is no trend in rate of missed appointments over the year by day. Even on major public holidays (of which the World Cup may be the greatest!) there is no noticeable change in absence rate around or on the holiday. This was backed up by the correlation coefficient which showed no linear relationship between day of year and the failure to attend statistic. The overall mean, plotted as the horizontal black line, shows the absence rate for all patients was 30.24%. Women on average had a slightly lower rate of 29.87% and men had a slightly higher rate at 31.00%. The gender discrepancy can barely be picked out on the graph, but it is present. Absence Rate vs. Age by SMS Reminders The second crucial visualization is the absence rate versus age broken down by number of SMS reminders. When I initially looked at the data showing that overall, people who received 2 text message reminders had higher absences rates, I was a little skeptical. However, after some thought, I realized that people who received text messages were likely to be younger, and I had seen that the younger the patient, the higher the absence rate. Therefore, I decided to look at the effect of text messages reminders at each given age. Based on the resulting chart, I saw that indeed, SMS reminders do reduce the absence rate at a specific age. To make the point clearer in the plot below, I plotted the average absence rate vs age for those who received no text reminders and for those who received either 1 or 2 reminders. The original graph was very noisy, so I applied a moving average over 5 years. The 5 year window was a selection based on the bias-variance tradeoff because while I wanted a smoother plot, I did not want to introduce a high amount of bias into the averages. After improving the graph, it is possible to observe the trend of fewer absences at older ages and the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing the failure to attend rate. The main two takeaways from this visualization are that as age increases, the absence rate decreases, and, at a given age, patients who receive at least one SMS reminder miss fewer appointments. The age distribution of missed appointments was in line with what I had expected, although I would have initially guessed that children under 10 would have the low absence rates comparable to what was observed in those aged 40 and over. It was not surprising to me that patients in their teens and early 20s had the highest failure to attend rate and it is clear that more effort needs to be expended in ensuring that this age group shows up for their appointments. This is one application where text message reminders could be most useful. Looking at the chart, it is also possible to observe that the rate of no-shows for those receiving an SMS reminder is lower than that for those recieving no reminder at almost every age. Overall, for a given age, text message reminders resulted in absence rates 0.5% lower which could make a substantial impact on the scale on a national health care system. Absence Rate vs. Waiting Time The third vital graph from this analysis was the relative absence rate vs waiting time graph. This graph displays the absence rate relative the overall mean absence rate for patient groups based on how far in advance they scheduled their appointment. I initially grouped the waiting time, or the elasped days between when the appointment was made and when the appointment occurred, by groups of five days. I then plotted the relative absence rate compared to the overall average for each group. I was surprised to discover how much lower the absence rate was for those sceduling less than 10 days in advance. To improve the plot, I increased the resolution of the graph by narrowing the bin widths to groups of 3 days. I also decided to add in a model created with the LOESS, Local Regression, method of regression. I created a simple model and then used the prediction it generated for each age grouping to draw a curve. The graph reveals the crucial information that appointments scheduled shorter out tend to have higher attendance rates. The actionable takeaway for patients from this graph is to schedule appointments on a shorter time scale, preferentially less than 10 days in advance. The absence rate for those whose appointments were scheduled only 3 days or less in advance was nearly 30% lower relative to the overall absence rate. Moreover, the model shows that the trend in increasing absence rate with longer waiting times is nearly linear for the first month. After that point, the noise in the visualization increases, but the majority of groups with wait times over 12 days had a higher absence rate than the mean. Patients would be wise to schedule their appointments as soon as possible in order to follow through on visiting the doctor. Taken together, these three visualizations illustrate several pieces of advice for patients and doctors who have a mutal interest in driving the absence rate as low as possible:\\n1. Day of the year does not affect the absence rate even near the holidays.\\n2. Young adults are the most likely to miss their appointments and therefore will need extra prodding to attend an appointment. This prodding can come in the form of SMS reminders, which reduce the absence rate for a given age.\\n3. Patients should schedule appointments as few days in advance as possible. Ideally appointments would occur within 9 days of being scheduled to increase the chance of attendance. The primary reason I wanted to learn the tools of data analysis was in order to could extract meaningful information from the mounds of data generated in our modern world. I want to be able to take hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points and extract insights which can be implemented in the real world to improve human institutions, such as the medical system. Exploring the patient no-show dataset has been a small step towards developing that ability. Although the sheer amount of data appeared overwhelming at first, and there were no correlations that immediately stood out, by selectively grouping the data and adjusting the visualization parameters, I was able to discover several key relationships.\\nThe main difficulty I had was beginning the analysis. With so many variables, it was a struggle to decide where I should first concentrate. However, once I started grouping the data, I found more and more directions I could explore until I felt that I was satisfied with the extent to which I had unraveled the data. The trends and patterns in the datadictate the questions that we should ask of it. R is a tricky language to pick up, but once I understood the patterns and syntax, I enjoyed the level of control it gave me over the visualizations. I was frustrated at times trying to perfect parameters of a graph, but in the end, I think I am a better data analyst because I had to work through all the intricacies of the R language. The next step forward, now that the exploratory data analysis of the no-shows dataset is complete, is to perform confirmatory data analysis. Based on my initial observations, I could form several hypotheses and then use rigorous statistical methods to test those hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis can discover potential relationships, but it takes statistical testing to determine whether these correlations are statistically meaningful. Moreover, this dataset is an ideal candidate for using machine learning to create classifiers that would identify patients likely to be a no-show at an appointment. The objective would be to make a model that would take in as features patient demographics and conditions, and would return the likelihood that a patient would fail to attend a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. If the model was accurate enough, it could then be implemented in the real-world by ensuring that patients most likely to miss a doctor\\u2019s visit receive additional persuasion. Moreover, with a more complete dataset, including city information or detailed demographics, more relationships could be discovered such as absence rate correlations with the weather or with access to public transportation. The initial exploratory data analysis of the doctor\\u2019s appointment no-show data has revealed numerous potential relationships. The dataset holds actionable information and this project demonstrates the benefits of not just collecting large amounts of data, but thoroughly analyzing it to find the correlations that could be used to improve patient outcomes and public health. Originally published at medium.com on August 8, 2017. Examining the Doctor\\u2019s Appointment No-Show Dataset Author\\u2019s Note: The following exploratory data analysis project was completed as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree that I finished in May 2017. All code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an applied setting. Doctor\\u2019s appointment no-shows are a serious issue in the public health care field. Missed appointments are associated with poorer patient outcomes and cost the health care system in the US nearly $200 each. Therefore, it comes as no small surprise that reducing the rate of no-shows has become a priority in the United States and around the world. Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to determine the most effective means of\\nreducing rates of absenteeism at with varying degrees of success. The first step to solving the problem of missed appointments is identifying why a patient skips a scheduled visit in the first place. What trends are there among patients with higher absence rates? Are there demographic indicators or perhaps time-variant relationships hiding in the data? Ultimately, it was these questions that drove my exploratory data analysis. I was curious as to the reasons behind missed appointments, and wanted to examine the data to identify any trends present. I choose this problem because I believe it is an excellent example of how data science and analysis can reveal relationships which can be implemented in the real-world to the benefit of society. I wanted to choose a dataset that was both relatable and could be used to make smarter decisions. Therefore, I decided to work with medical appointment no shows data available on Kaggle. This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit. There were a total of 14 variables I included from the original data. The variables and the description of the values are as follows Set up R Markdown Let\\u2019s take a look at the structure of the dataframe to identify cleaning/organizing that may need to be performed. From the structure of the dataframe, I can see there is some data housekeeping that needs to be done. First, I want to change the Status variable into an integer 0 or 1. A value of 1 will indicate that the patient did not show up as I am concerned with the variables that are most strongly correlated with a missed appointment. Moreover, I need to convert the registration date and the appointment date to date objects. I decided not to maintain the time (hours:minutes:seconds) associated with the registration date for the appointment although it was available (time of day was not available for the appointment date). I converted both the appointment registration date and appointment date to date objects so I could investigate seasonal and time patterns in the data. Based on the updated structure of the dataframe, it looks like I am on the right track but I still have a couple more modifications to make to the dataframe. I will create month, year, and day fields for the appointment and also rename the columns to a more consistent and readable format. That should about do it for the structure of the main dataframe. I am also concerned with missing/corrupted data, so I will look at the summary of each field to see if any obvious errors or outliers are present in the data. The summary of the no_shows dataframe reveals plenty of intriguing information as well as several errors that need to be corrected. Right away, it is clear that an age of -2 is not correct, and 113 is stretching the boundaries. However, looking at the oldest people in the world, it is plausible that 113 could be a correct age. I will filter out any negative ages and create a histogram of ages to see if there are a significant amount of outliers at the upper end. Moreover, this data summary shows that 30.24% of appointments are missed based on the mean for the status field. The rates for the various patient conditions can also be seen, and the most commonly coded reason for an appointment is hypertension at nearly 22% of visits. Also, the weekends appear to be a very unpopular time for doctor\\u2019s appointments in Brazil, or perhaps the clinics from which this data was drawn are not open on the weekend. Either way, I will need to keep the small sample size of appointments on the weekend in mind when I perform an analysis by weekday. Frequency Distribution of Ages The age histogram does not aligh exactly with my intutions though it is close. I expected that it would be bi-modal, with peaks in patient count at the youngest ages and at the oldest ages. However, while the largest number of patients do appear to be the youngest, the number of patients remains fairly constant into the middle ages, with a second peak around age 60 and then a steep decline into the oldest ages. Based on the visualization, there do not appear to be a large number of outliers in the upper range of the ages. I was skeptical of the high proportion of visits from those aged 0 and decided I needed to do some research. Based on the description of the dataset, this data is for primary care physicians in the public sector and so I looked for a breakdown of ages of patients at these appointments. I could not find statistics from Brazil, but based on official statistics from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, children under 1 year of age make up 2.6% of all physician visits. I can create a better plot showing the percentage each age is of all patients. I can also quickly check the percentage of visits comprised of patients aged 0 in the data. The calculation shows that 0-year olds make up 3.44% of visits. While the initial frequency distribution may looked skewed, the spread of the data along the years makes it look like 0-year olds make up considerably more of the visits than is actually the case. The corrected bar plot does a better job of representing the proportion of patients from each age. From the research by the CDC and the visualization, I conclude that the age distribution skew is not bad but rather legitimate data. To check for outliers in the waiting time field (or how long between the date the appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment), I will make another histogram. Based on the summary statistics of the dataframe, the longest waiting time was 398 days, with a median of 8 days, and a mean of 13.84 days. From the histogram and the statistics, it is clear that there are a small number of patients at the upper end of the distribution who schedule their appointment very far in advance. I wonder if the 398 days is accidentally a mistake that occured when someone choose the wrong year for their appointment! The graph is certainly long-tailed and positively skewed with a few extreme outliers at the upper limit. It appears there is only one patient with a waiting time over one year and just over 100 (out of 300000) with a waiting time of over six months. I will exclude the patient with the waiting time over one year, but I will treat the others as good but extreme data. Here is a version of the histogram that better represents the wait time for most patients. As can be seen in the chart, a plurality of patients wait less than 10 days between the scheduling and the date of their appointment. Based on these visualizations, and the summary statistics for the dataframe, I am confident that the data content of the main dataframe is valid. I can now start the exploration phase of exploratory data analysis! It is time to discover the relationships, or lack thereof, between the variables in the data. The first step I can take is to find the correlations between all of the columns to see if any stand out as particularly compelling. Of course, I expect that all the trends will not reveal themselves straight away. The rcorr function from the Hmisc library will calculate the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coeffient between every field of a dataframe. The Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of how linearly dependent two variables on each other. The coefficient value is between -1 and +1, and two variables that are perfectly linearly correlated will have a value of +1. From those correlation values, there are no standouts that are strong linear predictors of whether or not a patient will miss a visit (given by the status column). It appears that there are not even any strong relationships whatsoever though there is a moderate relationship between age and hypertension. However, I still think there are meaningful relationships to extract from the data. My approach will be to group the data by various fields and then determine if the average absence rate shows a relationship with the fields. The first group of variables I will look at will be those associated with the time-variability of the appointment date. Date of Appointment To start off the time-series analysis, I will want to look at absence rate by month of the year. I first needed to group the appointments by month of year and then find the average absence rate for each month. From the graph and the correlation coefficient, it appears there is a minor relationship between month of the year and absence rate. Missed visits do appear to rise as the year progresses, but with only 12 data points, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient is quite large (-0.05 to 0.85). I would expect that during the end of the year, people tend to be busier and may miss more appointments. It could also be possible that at the beginning of the year, individuals make resolutions to see the doctor and keep a higher percentage of appointments, but the trend could also be noise. Next, I will create a similar absence rate over time graph, but this time by day of the month. Looking at the plot we can see that there is a very slight positive correlation between day of the month and absence rate but again, the 95% confidence interval spans a wide range of values. To further explore any time variability in the data, I can create the same graph by day of the year and broken out by gender. From these charts, it appears looks as if there is no correlation betwen the time of year and the absence rate for appointments. Moreover, adding in the gender does not reveal any major descrepancies, although from the calculation, we can see that men on average have a 1% higher absence rate. There are several days for which the absence rate is 1, which bears some more investigation. My idea is that these points might corespond to public holidays. However, I also see that these days are not consistent across the two years, so maybe there are other major events that correspond to an increase in absences. I decided to overlay the holidays to see if that might reveal a relationship. I sourced the holidays based on public holidays in Brazil for each respective year. Again, it seems as if these holidays do not line up with higher rates of missed appointments. There is a sustained increase in the absence rate around the beginning of July, but it does not seem to correspond to any holidays. I researched festivals in Brazil in June-July 2015, and it appears that the Paraty International Literary Festival occured July 1\\u20135, but I doubt that this explains the absence rate. There was not city data associated with the original dataset, so it is difficult to attempt to cross-reference specific dates with specific events.\\nI will create a simliar graph for 2014. I remember that the 2014 soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, so perhaps the time around the world cup will have a higher absence rate. I will plot a few holidays and then the dates surrounding the World Cup (which lasted for a month). Perhaps there is a slight increase in absence rate during the World Cup? The graph does not clearly indicate either was but I can compare the average absence rate during the World Cup to the average absence rate over the entire length of 2014. There is a small boost, but not a significant rise in the absence rate during the World Cup. It looks like in terms of time variability, there is no significant correlation based on the day of the year or the day of the month. There is one more time variation I want to look at, and that is day of the week. To remind myself of the small sample sizes on the weekend, I also show the appointment days of the week count. Finally, it looks like there might be some time variability in this data when it is broken down by weekday. Excluding Saturday and Sunday because of their small sample sizes, Monday and Friday have the highest absence rate and Tuesday has the lowest. I will alter the plot to show the absence rate as a relative percentage change from the overall mean absence rate. Based on this chart, patients are 6% more likely to miss an appointment on a Monday compared to the overall average absence rate, and 4% less likely to miss an appointment on a Tuesday. This is an actionable discovery for both patients and doctors! If patients want to keep their appointments, and if doctors want to make sure their patients show up, they should schedule their appointments during the middle three days of the week. Patient Age I wanted to move on from the time variability and look at the demographic data. In particular, I am interested in whether or not age is correlated with absence rate. My initial guess would be that the youngest and the oldest patients would tend to have lower absence rates. Meanwhile, those patients in the middle would generally be healthier and thus would feel more inclined to skip an appointment. (Everyone is convinced they are invincible in their 20s. In fact, this was one of the issues associated with the initial rollout of Obamacare. Too many young, healthy individuals did not believe they needed insurance and therefore did not sign up for healthcare.) First I will group patients by age and then visualize the average absence rates. The chart reveals the possibility of a negative relationship between age and absence rate. First though, it is clear that the outliers in the upper end of the data introduce substantial variance. As there are only 719 patients over 90 out of 300000 entries, I think I can filter out any ages over 90 without impacting the validating of the data while reducing the noise. I will use that filter and then improve the aesthetics of the graph. We can observe that the youngest ages have a relatively low absence rate with an exception for 1-year-olds. The absence rate then climbs for teenagers, peaking around age 20, before beginning a long, gradual decline to around 70, at which point the absence rate rises again slightly. I would like to know precisely which ages have the highest and lowest absence rates. Moreover, what is the pearson correlation between age and absence rate? Here are more actionable conclusions. Public health officials need to work on getting teenagers to show up to their appointments! This is expecially crucial because studies have shown that habits form very early and are hard to change later in life. A trend of going to the doctor while younger will likely persist as a patient ages and lead to better lifelong health. We can further bin the data in five years increments to highlight the \\u201cproblem years\\u201d, that is, the years with the highest missed appointment rate. I will plot the relative absence rate, or the average age group absence rate as a percentage relative to the average absence rate for all ages. Remember, in this plot, below the x-axis is better because it indicates that the age group has a lower rate of missed appointments than the average. Based on the chart, is it clear that the worst group in terms of absence rate is 15\\u201320 year-olds and the best group for attedance is 70\\u201375 year-olds. The visualization and the statistics are definitive when it comes to ages and missed appointments. The correlation between ages and absence rate is -0.86, which is strongly negative and indicates that as the age of the patient increases, statistically, that patient is less likely to miss a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. Waiting Time After finding a strong relationship between age and absence rate, I will move on to examine other variables. I would like to search for a possible trend in absence rate by waiting time, or the time between when an appointment was scheduled, and when the appointment took place. My hypothesis is that patients with a longer waiting time will have a higher missed appointment rate because their condition has more time to change in the interim period. Moreover, I think that patients with a shorter waiting time are more likely to need urgent care or have a problem they deem to be pressing, and it would certainly be in their best interest to show up at the appointment. The graph and the correlation coefficient seem to demonstrate a lack of any relationship. However, thinking back on the histogram of waiting time from the initial exploration, the majority of the patients waited under 100 days. There are far fewer data points from people waiting more than 100 days, which is why the average absence rate for those times tends to be either 0% or 100%. If I limit the data to people with a waiting time less than 3 months (90 days), might there exist a relationship? Furthermore, I will group the data into 10 day segments. If the data is limited to those patients who scheduled fewer than 3 months in advance, there is a slight positive correlation between waiting time and absence rate. I tried to do some research on this subject in general, and found this from the Safety Net Dental Clinic: \\u201cExperience in many safety net dental programs also suggests that the incidence of broken appointments increases when appointments are scheduled more than three weeks in advance.\\u201d Based on my analysis, I concur. Patients who schedule less than 10 days out are 20% less likely to miss an appointment than those scheduling further out. The Safety Net Dental Clinic page mentions that often other life events get in the way when we schedule too far out, and although that may be a slightly different situation, the general pattern appears to hold in this case. Add a point to schedule as few days out as possible to the list of recommendations for patients looking to adhere to a scheduled appointment. SMS Reminders One of the most intriguing aspects of the dataset to me was the SMS (Short Message Service) text message reminder counts. Text message reminders have been implemented in many clinics because of their ease of use and low cost. Moreover, they have been shown to be effective in some situations. I want to examine this data to discover how or if SMS messages correlate with a failure to attend. I would think that patients who recieve SMS messages will be more likely to attend the appointment than those not receiving them. However, this could be complicated by the fact that younger patients are more likely to sign up for text message alerts, and as we have already seen, young individuals are more inclined to be record a no-show. Therefore, I will probably need to further look at who exactly is recieving the text messages in addition to the correlation between text messages and attendance at the appointment. The graph is somewhat surprising to me; one text message seems to decrease the absence rate while two increases the absence rate significantly. I would have expected more SMS reminders to be strongly correlated with a decrease in absence rate. Maybe the direction of this relationship is the opposite of what I thought. Instead of SMS messages persuading patients to attend a scheduled appointment, patients who are least likely to attend an appointment receive more text messages. One way to check for this would be to look at average SMS messages per appointment received by age. I expect there might be odd behavior at the ends of this graph (how young do children receive their first phone nowadays? Has the average 80-year old embraced text messages?). I expect that segmenting by age might reveal more nuances than the overall absence rate vs text messages. Sure enough, the average number of SMS reminders per appointment is greater among the younger ages. I looked through the data provider information, and I could not ascertain whether or not those SMS reminders were to the parent in the case of a very young child but that seems likely. From the statistics and the plot, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of SMS messages and the age of the patient. To further explore the absence rate vs text message, I will recreate the absence rate vs age graph, but this time, create separate curves for number of SMS reminders received. Looking at the graph, we can see that the absence rate versus age grouped by number of SMS reminders looks much the same for the 0 or 1 reminders. However, the graph for 2 reminders is much noisier. I suspect that is due to the lower sample size of people receiving two reminders (which was the maximum). In order to determine if there is an effect from text message reminders at a given age, I need to create a plot showing the difference in absence rates at each age between those receiving any reminder and those receiving no reminder. ```\\nIndeed, it does appears that at a given age, the absence rate decreases with 1 or 2 text messages reminders. In fact, the average difference in absence rate holding age constant is -0.57%. That means that having receiving an SMS reminder at a given age decreases the chance that a patient will miss a scheduled appointment by 0.6%. This may seem small, but it could add up over millions of appointments. Moreover, there are certain ages when the effect of the SMS reminders is much greater. The reduction in missed appointments is as great as 2% at age ten and near 3% during other years. This reduction in the failure to attend rate is also what research into text message reminders has found. One study,conducted in Brazil, found: \\u201cThe nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p = .590), 3.55% (p = .009), 5.75% (p = .022), and 14.49% (p = <.001).\\u201d Furthermore, the conclusion of this research was: \\u201cThe study results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients\\u2019 cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving uninterrupted care benefit.\\u201d Based on my analysis of the data, I must concur that at a given age, SMS reminders decrease the absence rate. Another valuable piece of information that could be quite easily implemented in the real world to improve outcomes! Patient Markers The final step in this exploratory analysis is to look at the absence rate by the condition for which the patient visited the doctor. I will group by the markers in the original data and then look at each average absence rate. There are considerable differences illustrated between those with different markers. Tuberculosis has the highest rate of absence, followed by alcoholism. However, these conditions also make up a small sample of the overall visits. Diabetes and hypertension have the lowest absence rate. Interestingly, patients marked as being part of the Bolsa Familia welfare program have a high rate of absences. This program rewards patients for attending appointments, which should induce patients to visit their doctor more often. Perhaps there are other factors at play here though. It could be that families on the welfare program cannot take the time to visit the doctor because of the opportunity cost of not working. To put the conditions in perspective, here is the percentage of all visits each condition makes up. The final plot I can make is of the conditions and the relative percentage difference in absence rates compared to the mean absence rate. Relative difference plots are helpful to me because it is possible to quickly identify if one variable is above or below the average. Again, for this particular plot, values below the x-axis are great because it means the absence rate is lower than the overall average. Create the relative absence rate compared to the age versus condition plot. The differences between conditions here are stark. Again, the smaller sample sizes associated with alcoholism and tuberculosis must be taken into account, but it is clear that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to attend an appointment. In fact, they are more than 15% less likely to miss an appointment then the average patient. This is an interesting result and I wonder if it is because of the constant need for care when treating both of these conditions. However, it would seem like all of the conditions require care on an ongoing basis. I would need more detailed condition information before I drew any conclusions about possible causes of the absence rates broken out by condition. I started this project off with a single simple question: what factors are most likely to determine whether or not a patient shows up to their scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment? As the exploratory data analysis went on, I found this one question had branched into dozens. Does the number of SMS reminders correlate with absence rates? How about if we compare SMS reminders for a given age? Are there major variabilities that we can observe associated with holidays? I found my curiousity and interest in the dataset only grew as I delved further and further. Although at first it appeared there were few meaningful relationships, by grouping and segmenting the data, clear trends emerged. Keeping in mind that this dataset may not be representative of all countries and health care systems, the following are the most notable discoveries from the patient no-show data: 2. There is a slight positive correlation between absence rate and the day of the month and as the month progresses, the percentage of missed appointments rises moderately. 3. There is no correlation in the absence rate over the days of the year. 4. Excluding the weekends, the day of the week with the highest absence rate is Monday followed by Friday. Tuesday had the lowest rate of absences with appointments on Tuesday 4% more likely to be attended than those on the other days of the week. 5. The age of patients was demonstrated a strong negative linear correlation with absence rates with a correlation coefficient of -0.86. 6. There was a slight positive correlation between the rate of missed appointments and how many days in advance the patient scheduled the appointment. 7. When looking at the dataset as a whole, patients who recieved two SMS reminders were more likely to miss an appointment than those who recieved no reminders. However, the correlation between age and average text messages recieved was -0.80 meaning that younger patients, who were more likely to miss appointments overall, received more text messages. Subsequently, the effect of text messages reminders can only be revealed by looking at messages received at a given age. 8. Patients whose appointments were marked for tuberculosis and alcoholism were the most likely to miss the visit, while those coded for hypertension and diabetes were the least likely to miss their appointment. These are but a few briefs observations that can be gleaned from this dataset. Keeping in mind that correlations do not imply causations (more serious link for those interested), and that some of the groupings results in small sample sizes, there are actionable items that with appropriate further study, could be implemented in the health care system. The final aspect of the project was to revisit and refine three of my earlier plots. Primarily I am concerned with whether or not the visualizations correctly convey the information within the dataset. My secondary objective is of course aesthetics because what good is even the most informative chart if it is not presentable? Absence Rate vs. Day of the Year This first chart was notable to me because of the lack of relationships it revealed. It is the graph of absence rate versus day of the year in 2014 with holidays (and the World Cup) included. I would have initially believed that absence rates spiked around holidays and near the end of the year. However, no clear trend emerged from this plot. In order to improve the information content and the aesthetics, I altered some of the colors, changed the scale on the axis, added in the mean absence rate for reference, and made sure all labels were accurate. The conclusion to draw from this visualization is that there is no trend in rate of missed appointments over the year by day. Even on major public holidays (of which the World Cup may be the greatest!) there is no noticeable change in absence rate around or on the holiday. This was backed up by the correlation coefficient which showed no linear relationship between day of year and the failure to attend statistic. The overall mean, plotted as the horizontal black line, shows the absence rate for all patients was 30.24%. Women on average had a slightly lower rate of 29.87% and men had a slightly higher rate at 31.00%. The gender discrepancy can barely be picked out on the graph, but it is present. Absence Rate vs. Age by SMS Reminders The second crucial visualization is the absence rate versus age broken down by number of SMS reminders. When I initially looked at the data showing that overall, people who received 2 text message reminders had higher absences rates, I was a little skeptical. However, after some thought, I realized that people who received text messages were likely to be younger, and I had seen that the younger the patient, the higher the absence rate. Therefore, I decided to look at the effect of text messages reminders at each given age. Based on the resulting chart, I saw that indeed, SMS reminders do reduce the absence rate at a specific age. To make the point clearer in the plot below, I plotted the average absence rate vs age for those who received no text reminders and for those who received either 1 or 2 reminders. The original graph was very noisy, so I applied a moving average over 5 years. The 5 year window was a selection based on the bias-variance tradeoff because while I wanted a smoother plot, I did not want to introduce a high amount of bias into the averages. After improving the graph, it is possible to observe the trend of fewer absences at older ages and the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing the failure to attend rate. The main two takeaways from this visualization are that as age increases, the absence rate decreases, and, at a given age, patients who receive at least one SMS reminder miss fewer appointments. The age distribution of missed appointments was in line with what I had expected, although I would have initially guessed that children under 10 would have the low absence rates comparable to what was observed in those aged 40 and over. It was not surprising to me that patients in their teens and early 20s had the highest failure to attend rate and it is clear that more effort needs to be expended in ensuring that this age group shows up for their appointments. This is one application where text message reminders could be most useful. Looking at the chart, it is also possible to observe that the rate of no-shows for those receiving an SMS reminder is lower than that for those recieving no reminder at almost every age. Overall, for a given age, text message reminders resulted in absence rates 0.5% lower which could make a substantial impact on the scale on a national health care system. Absence Rate vs. Waiting Time The third vital graph from this analysis was the relative absence rate vs waiting time graph. This graph displays the absence rate relative the overall mean absence rate for patient groups based on how far in advance they scheduled their appointment. I initially grouped the waiting time, or the elasped days between when the appointment was made and when the appointment occurred, by groups of five days. I then plotted the relative absence rate compared to the overall average for each group. I was surprised to discover how much lower the absence rate was for those sceduling less than 10 days in advance. To improve the plot, I increased the resolution of the graph by narrowing the bin widths to groups of 3 days. I also decided to add in a model created with the LOESS, Local Regression, method of regression. I created a simple model and then used the prediction it generated for each age grouping to draw a curve. The graph reveals the crucial information that appointments scheduled shorter out tend to have higher attendance rates. The actionable takeaway for patients from this graph is to schedule appointments on a shorter time scale, preferentially less than 10 days in advance. The absence rate for those whose appointments were scheduled only 3 days or less in advance was nearly 30% lower relative to the overall absence rate. Moreover, the model shows that the trend in increasing absence rate with longer waiting times is nearly linear for the first month. After that point, the noise in the visualization increases, but the majority of groups with wait times over 12 days had a higher absence rate than the mean. Patients would be wise to schedule their appointments as soon as possible in order to follow through on visiting the doctor. Taken together, these three visualizations illustrate several pieces of advice for patients and doctors who have a mutal interest in driving the absence rate as low as possible:\\n1. Day of the year does not affect the absence rate even near the holidays.\\n2. Young adults are the most likely to miss their appointments and therefore will need extra prodding to attend an appointment. This prodding can come in the form of SMS reminders, which reduce the absence rate for a given age.\\n3. Patients should schedule appointments as few days in advance as possible. Ideally appointments would occur within 9 days of being scheduled to increase the chance of attendance. The primary reason I wanted to learn the tools of data analysis was in order to could extract meaningful information from the mounds of data generated in our modern world. I want to be able to take hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points and extract insights which can be implemented in the real world to improve human institutions, such as the medical system. Exploring the patient no-show dataset has been a small step towards developing that ability. Although the sheer amount of data appeared overwhelming at first, and there were no correlations that immediately stood out, by selectively grouping the data and adjusting the visualization parameters, I was able to discover several key relationships.\\nThe main difficulty I had was beginning the analysis. With so many variables, it was a struggle to decide where I should first concentrate. However, once I started grouping the data, I found more and more directions I could explore until I felt that I was satisfied with the extent to which I had unraveled the data. The trends and patterns in the datadictate the questions that we should ask of it. R is a tricky language to pick up, but once I understood the patterns and syntax, I enjoyed the level of control it gave me over the visualizations. I was frustrated at times trying to perfect parameters of a graph, but in the end, I think I am a better data analyst because I had to work through all the intricacies of the R language. The next step forward, now that the exploratory data analysis of the no-shows dataset is complete, is to perform confirmatory data analysis. Based on my initial observations, I could form several hypotheses and then use rigorous statistical methods to test those hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis can discover potential relationships, but it takes statistical testing to determine whether these correlations are statistically meaningful. Moreover, this dataset is an ideal candidate for using machine learning to create classifiers that would identify patients likely to be a no-show at an appointment. The objective would be to make a model that would take in as features patient demographics and conditions, and would return the likelihood that a patient would fail to attend a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. If the model was accurate enough, it could then be implemented in the real-world by ensuring that patients most likely to miss a doctor\\u2019s visit receive additional persuasion. Moreover, with a more complete dataset, including city information or detailed demographics, more relationships could be discovered such as absence rate correlations with the weather or with access to public transportation. The initial exploratory data analysis of the doctor\\u2019s appointment no-show data has revealed numerous potential relationships. The dataset holds actionable information and this project demonstrates the benefits of not just collecting large amounts of data, but thoroughly analyzing it to find the correlations that could be used to improve patient outcomes and public health.\",\n          \"On a warm Boston summer in 2018, I was just settling onto the lawn at the Hatch Memorial Shell for a performance of my favorite symphony \\u2014 Holst\\u2019s The Planets \\u2014 when I saw a tent set up by the Union of Concerned Scientists. As someone generally concerned about the state of science, I wandered over and as I got closer, was drawn to a crowd gathered around a man discussing the threat of nuclear weapons. Having just finished Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker, I was hoping to hear more positive news about the massive reductions in nuclear weapon stockpiles that occurred over the past 30 years. Instead, the man\\u2019s speech \\u2014 as Pinker tells us to expect from academics \\u2014 was entirely negative. The gist was that human folly led us to create weapons which could wipe our species off the face of the Earth and we were in grave danger. Perplexed, when the man paused to take a breathe, I raised my hand and asked if he knew how many nukes there were worldwide and how this compared to numbers in the past. Confidently he replied: \\u201cThere\\u2019s more now than ever before although I don\\u2019t know the exact number.\\u201d At this point, buoyed by the confidence (and arrogance) that comes with possessing data someone else doesn\\u2019t, I pressed my factual advantage for all its worth stating: \\u201cIn 1985, there were approximately 70,000 nuclear weapons in the world, and today, in 2018, there are less than 15,000. That represents a reduction of nearly 80%, and what\\u2019s more, there are 4 fewer countries with nuclear weapons today.\\u201d Surprised, the man asked for a fact check, and after an acceptable source was consulted, he acknowledged the optimistic numbers were correct. While my intention was not to defang the man, this was the unintended effect, and the crowd slowly began to disperse, the gusto gone from the man\\u2019s proclamations. Although I had inadvertently cost the man his entire audience, he agreed to have a discussion with me (after I apologized for the intellectual ambush) and we had a fruitful debate with both of us making concessions: I agreed that 0 nuclear weapons was optimal (although not realistic at the moment) and he said he would reframe his message to emphasize the progress we\\u2019ve made in nuclear weapons reduction. Later, as I sat listening to the sounds of Holst\\u2019s magnificent work, I thought about what this experience had taught me: In this article, we are going to examine the data concerning nuclear weapons around the world. The basic stats above are correct \\u2014 the number of nuclear weapons and the number of countries holding them have both declined drastically in the past 30 years. However, there are also points about which we should rightly worry, including tension between the US and Russia which threatens arms control treaties and the possession of nuclear weapons by unstable states. In addition to the numbers, we\\u2019ll also learn about Megatons to Megawatts, the most intriguing government program you\\u2019ve probably never heard of, in which Russian bombs literally turned on your lights. This article is the third episode of The Reality Project, an effort aimed at becoming less wrong about the world with data. You can find the previous article here and all of the articles by searching for the Reality Project tag. Our data in this article will come from Our World in Data: Nuclear Weapons, Federation of American Scientists: Status of World Nuclear Forces, and The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker (who cites Scott Sagan). We will also talk about nuclear arms treaties with information from the Arms Control Association and the State Department . Information on the Megatons to Megawatts program is from the Arms Control Association. Exact data on the size of nuclear weapon arsenals is a closely held secret, nonetheless, we can get fairly reliable estimates due to international agreements and monitoring programs. From the objective data, we clearly see a decreasing trend in the number of nuclear weapons worldwide. Here is the global total of nuclear weapons over time (from Our World in Data): The global nuclear stockpile peaked in 1985 and has been on a rapid decline ever since. Again, exact estimates differ, but the Federation of American Scientists states numbers went from 70,300 to 14,485 as of 2018. This respresents nearly an 80% decline in total nuclear weapons! Today, there are 9 countries with confirmed nuclear weapons (it is unlikely there are additional countries with weapons due to the technology/material needs and international monitoring): Russia currently has more overall nuclear weapons, while the United States has more deployed weapons. The state and type of nuclear weapons are just as important as the sheer numbers: The total in military use (deployed + stockpiled) is just under 10,000 with about 1,800 weapons on high alert. For all types of nuclear weapons, the worldwide total has declined substantially. For example, in 1986, Russia along had 40,000 nukes and now has under 7,000. The United States went from 31,000 in 1966 to under 7,000 in 2018. Another surprising piece of news is there are now fewer countries with nuclear weapons. 4 countries once had nuclear weapons but no longer do: South Africa, Belarus, Kazakhstan (which had 1,400), and Ukraine, which willingly gave up 5,000 nuclear weapons, the third-largest arsenal in the world. Moreover, many countries that were pursuing nuclear weapons at one point have since given up their nuclear weapon development. In the below chart, we see when nations started and gave up trying to develop nuclear weapons (preceded with a \\u2014 ). Not only are countries with existing nuclear weapons working to reduce the number they have, but numerous other countries have decided that pursuing nuclear weapons is not something they want to do. In 1990, there were 13 countries in the world with nuclear weapons, a number that has dropped to 9 countries today. This is certainly positive, but three of the countries with nuclear weapons are concerning. India and Pakistan have fought 3 wars against one another, and North Korea is a complete unknown. The decline in nuclear tests has been even more impressive than that of weapons. Since the start of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban-Treaty (which has not entered into force but is followed by the major world powers) in 1996, the US and Russian have not conducted a single test. Moreover, since 1999, only one country, North Korea, has done any nuclear testing at all. The cumulative world total of nuclear tests is over 2000, but only 6 (0.3%) occurred after 2000. We can see where these tests happened in this map: In summary, today there are around 15,000 nuclear weapons in the world (9,300 of which are in military use) held by 9 nations. 4 nations have given up their weapons while at least a dozen others have ceased development. The number of nuclear tests has declined to nearly 0 with only North Korea conducting any since 1999. Finally, projections for 2020 suggest there will be around 8,000 total nuclear weapons in the world. The decline in the size of global nuclear arsenals is undoubtedly a positive and as with any statistic, it\\u2019s helpful to understand why this happened so we can figure out if it will hold and what we can do to keep the trend on track. In short, the reduction in nuclear weapons has come about because of international treaties designed to reduce arsenals. We don\\u2019t have the space to address all of them (see here for a comprehensive list) but we\\u2019ll talk about several between the US and Russia. Together, these two countries control over 90% of nuclear weapons, so these agreements have a significant influence. An overview of nuclear reduction treaties between the US and Russia is here: From the table, we can see that not every negotiation was successful. Nonetheless, the treaties that have been agreed to have been effective. For instance, START I (Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty), proposed by Ronald Reagan in the 1980s, (it was delayed by the collapse of the USSR) achieved all objectives, with Russia and the US reducing weapons to 6,000 each by 2001. START I expired in 2009, but by that point, the SORT (Strategic Offensive Reductions Treaty) agreement was in place which further limited both US and Russian stockpiles. As a note of optimism, this treaty was passed in the Senate by a vote of 95\\u20130 indicating that both parties can at least agree we don\\u2019t need the threat of annihilation hanging over our heads like a Sword of Damacles. The current treaty limiting nuclear weapons, New START, was ratified in 2010 with reductions completed by 2018. We can examine effect of this treaty by comparing the number of warheads before (left) and after (right) completion: Based on the final numbers (far right column), but the US and Russia have fewer deployed warheads than required by the Treaty (1,550)! The New Start Treaty officially expires in 2021, with options to extend it for 5 more years. The current President of the United States has voiced disdain for New Start, but there are no indications that the treaty will end early. (For a discussion of current developments, refer to this page from the arms control association.) With the present political climate, it is unclear what future arms control reduction measures will be put in place. Given the success of previous efforts, further arms reduction treaties must be a priority for both the US and Russia. Verification of these treaties involves on-site inspections, exchanges of information, remote monitoring, and surveillance including satellites. To prove the US had followed START I, 365 B-52 bombers were flown to Arizona, stripped of usable parts, and then chopped into pieces. They were left out for 3 months to allow Russian satellites to confirm the destruction. Other reductions of nuclear war threats have come without a bilateral agreement, including in 1991 when George H.W. Bush announced the US would remove almost all US nonstrategic (these are also called tactical nuclear weapons and are designed to be used on a battlefield) nuclear arms from deployment as the Soviet Union dissolved. As planned, the Soviet Union responded in kind, with Mikhail Gorbachev promising to withdraw all tactical Soviet nuclear weapons from naval deployment. This act alone, officially known as the Presidential Nuclear Initiatives (PNI) reduced the total number of nuclear weapons in the world by about 18,000. Although Russian and the US still possess both strategic and non-strategic nuclear weapons, the totals are at all-time lows (for a discussion of whether this will hold, see here). Sometimes, especially when the fate of the world hangs in the balance, the government can do some amazing things. One lesser-known case is the \\u201cMegatons to Megawatts\\u201d program in which 500 tons of highly enriched uranium (HEU) from Russian nuclear weapons was converted into low-enriched uranium (LEU) and sold to United States companies to be used as fuel in nuclear power plants. The total impact of this astonishing program was that 500 metric tons of HEU \\u2014 enough for 20,000 nuclear warheads \\u2014 was converted into 14,000 tons of LEU and used to power nuclear reactors around the United States. (The cost of this 20-year program to taxpayers was $0 because the $12 billion of uranium was bought by the United States Enrichment Corporation.) Over the 18 years of the program (1995\\u20132013), the LEU fuel provided about 50% of all uranium consumed by US nuclear reactors, meaning almost 10% of electricity generated in the United States was from old Russian nuclear weapons! If you get any of your power from a nuclear station, then your lights were literally turned on by Russian nuclear weapons: The total benefits of Megatons to Megawatts were enormous to both countries. The United States needed fuel for its nuclear reactors, and Russia needed cash after the fall of the Soviet Union. Both parties got exactly what they needed with the program successfully ending in 2013. Since then, the US has voluntary converted some of its HEU to LEU so it cannot be used in weapons and an agreement was signed in 2008 allowing the Russian nuclear industry to supply up to 20% of the US demand for uranium products until 2020. The importance of the Megatons to Megawatts program \\u2014 in addition to material benefits \\u2014 is it shows that countries can overcome their differences, particularly when it is in both parties economic interest to do so. It also proved that former enemies can work together and resolve disputes peacefully. As we think of how to resolve situations in our personal lives and on an international scale, we\\u2019d be wise to keep this program in mind: compromise means that both sides don\\u2019t get everything they want, but everyone eventually benefits. Nuclear weapons are not going away for the foreseeable future. While in a perfect world there would be 0 nukes, we live in reality, not in a utopia. Therefore, as a short-term realist and long-term optimist, I appreciate the significant progress we have made \\u2014 massive reductions in the number of nuclear weapons \\u2014 while acknowledging the need for continued reductions. Furthermore, while I am glad there are concerned scientists, I would like them more if they had their facts straight before they speak from a position of prominence. Telling people the world is worse than it is will not lead to action, but to disillusionment and the belief that things can never get better. It\\u2019s worth remembering that progress is never directly linear, but has been trending positively for most of human history and has sped up in the past several decades. As nuclear weapons demonstrate, things could be both much worse and much better, and international efforts do work on a global scale. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. The pursuit of astronomy has been a gradual process of uncovering the insignificance of humanity. We started out in the center of the universe with the cosmos literally revolving around us. Then we were rudely relegated to one of 8 planets orbiting the sun, a sun which subsequently was revealed to be just one of billions of stars (and not even a large one) in our galaxy. This galaxy, the majestic Milky Way, seemed pretty impressive until Hubble discovered that all those fuzzy objects in the sky are billions of other galaxies, each of which has billions of stars (potentially with their own intelligent life). The demotion has only continued in the 21st century, as mathematicians and physicists have concluded the universe is one of an infinity of universes collectively called the multiverse. On top of the relegation to a smaller and smaller part of the cosmos, now some thinkers are claiming we live in a simulation, and soon will create our own simulated worlds. All of this is a long way to say we are not special. The idea that the Earth, and by extension humanity, does not occupy a privileged place in the universe is known as the Copernican Principle. While the Copernican Principle was first used with respect to our physical location \\u2014 x, y, and z coordinates \\u2014 in 1993, J Richard Gott applied the concept that we aren\\u2019t special observers to our universe\\u2019s fourth dimension, time. In \\u201cImplications of the Copernican principle for our future prospects\\u201d ($200 here or free through the questionably legal SciHub here), Gott explained that if we assume we don\\u2019t occupy a unique moment in history, we can use a basic equation to predict the lifetime of any phenomenon. The equation, in its simple brilliance (derivation at the end of article) is: Where t_current is the amount of time something has already been around, t_future is the expected amount of time it will last from now, and confidence interval expresses how certain we are in the estimate. This equation is based on a simple idea: we don\\u2019t exist at a unique moment in time and therefore, when we observe an event, we are most likely watching the middle and not the beginning or the conclusion. As with any equation, the best way to figure out how it works is to input some numbers. Let's apply this to something simple, say the lifetime of the human species. We\\u2019ll use a 95% confidence interval and assume modern humans have been around for 200,000 years. Plugging in the numbers, we get: The answer to the classic dinner-party question (okay, only the dinner parties I go to) of how long humans will be around is 5130 to 7.8 million years with 95% confidence. This is in close agreement with actual evidence that shows the mean duration of a mammal species is about 2 million years with the Neanderthals making it 300,000 years and Homo erectus 1.6 million years. The neat part about this equation is it can be applied to anything while relying only on statistics instead of trying to untangle a complex underlying web of causes. How long a television show runs for, the lifetime of a technology, or the length of time a company exists are all subject to numerous factors that are impossible to tease apart. Rather than digging through all the causes, we can take advantage of the temporal (a fancy word for time) Copernican Principle and arrive at a decent estimate for the lifetime of any phenomenon. To apply the equation to something closer to home, data science, we first need to find the current lifetime of the field, which we\\u2019ll put at 6 years based on when the Harvard Business Review released the article \\u201cData Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century\\u201d. Then, we use the equation to find we can expect, with 95% confidence, data science will be around for at least another 8 weeks, and at most, 234 years. If we want a narrower estimate, we reduce our confidence interval: at 50%, we get from 2 to 18 years. If you want to play around with the numbers, here\\u2019s a Jupyter Notebook. You might object the answers from this equation are ridiculously wide, a point I\\u2019ll concede. However, the objective is not to get a single number \\u2014 there are almost no situations, even when using the best algorithm, that we can find the one number guaranteed to be spot on \\u2014 but to find a plausible range. I like to think of the Copernican Lifetime Equation as a Fermi estimate, a back of the envelope style calculation named for the physicist Enrico Fermi. In 1945, with nothing more than some scraps of paper, Fermi estimated the yield of the Trinity atomic bomb test to within a factor of 2! Likewise, we can use the equation to get a reasonable estimate for the lifetime of a phenomenon. There are two important lessons, one technical, one philosophical, from using the Copernican Principle to find out how long something will be around: With regards to the first point, if you want to figure out how long a Broadway show will run, where do you even start gathering data? You could look at reviews, actors\\u2019 reputations, or even the dialogue in the script to determine the appeal and figure out how much longer the show will go on. Or, you could do as Gott did, apply his simple equation, and correctly predict the runtimes of 42 out of 44 shows on Broadway. On the latter point, as Nassim Taleb points out in his book Antifragile, the easiest way to figure out how long a non-perishable item \\u2014 such as an idea or a work of art \\u2014 will be around is to look at its current lifetime. In other words, the future lifetime of a technology is proportional to its past lifetime. This is known as the Lindy Effect and makes sense with a little thought: a concept that has been around for a long time \\u2014 books as a medium for exchanging information \\u2014 must have a reason for surviving so long, and we can expect it to persist far into the future. On the other hand, a new idea\\u2014 Google Glass \\u2014 is statistically unlikely to survive because of the vast number of new concepts arising every single day. For one more telling example of the Copernican Lifetime Equation, consider the brilliant tweet you sent an hour ago. Statistics tell us this will be relevant for between 90 more seconds to a little less than 2 days. On the other hand, the oldest English story, Beowulf, will still be read by bored students at least 26 years from now and up to 39,000 years in the future. What\\u2019s more, this story won\\u2019t be experienced in virtual reality \\u2014 consumer virtual reality having between 73 days and 311 more years \\u2014 but on the most durable form of media, books, which have 29.5 to 45000 years of dominance left. Some people may view the Copernican Principle \\u2014 both temporal and spatial \\u2014 as a tragedy, but I find it exciting. Much as we realized the stunning grandeur of the universe only after we discarded the geocentric model, once we let go of the myth that our time is special and that we exist at the pinnacle of humanity, the possibilities are vast. Yes, we may be insignificant on a cosmic scale now, but 5000 years from now our ancestors \\u2014 or possibly us \\u2014 will expand throughout and even fundamentally alter the Milky Way. As David Deutsch points out in his book The Fabric of Reality, anything not prohibited by the laws of physics will be achieved by humans given enough time. Instead of worrying that the job you\\u2019re supposed to be doing now is meaningless, think of it as contributing to the great endeavor upon which humanity has embarked. We are currently subject to the Copernican Principle, but maybe humans really are different: after all, we are starstuff that has evolved the ability to contemplate our place in the universe. The derivation of the Copernican Lifetime Equation is as follows. The total lifetime of anything is the current lifetime plus the future lifetime: If we don\\u2019t believe our temporal location is privileged, then our observation of a phenomenon occurs neither at the beginning nor the end: Make the following substitution for z: Insert the definition of the total lifetime to get: Then solve for the future lifetime of any phenomenon: With a confidence interval of 95%, we get the multiplicative factors 1/39 and 39; with a confidence interval of 50%, the factors are 1/3 and 3; for 99% confidence, our factors become 1/199 and 199. You can play around with the equations in this Jupyter Notebook. Also, take a look at the original paper by Gott for more details. As always, I welcome constructive criticism and feedback. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. \\u201cThe unexamined life is not worth living\\u201d is one of those cliches people throw out when they want to sound profound. The problem is the people who hear this, wanting to seem educated themselves, will nod and accept it without a question, leading to the spread of what is best described as \\u201cpseudo-profound dribble\\u201d (dribble being a family-friendly replacement for the correct term). In reality, a life lived without looking back is totally worth living; in fact, those who live in the present are generally happier than those who dwell on the past. As I\\u2019ve written, thinking too much about the past can lead to regret as we second-guess our decisions that didn\\u2019t go well. There are even entire philosophies \\u2014 Stoicism \\u2014 about living in the present and letting go of the past. Those Socrates-quoting (it was probably Socrates who uttered this quote, at least according to Plato) people don\\u2019t even think about what they are saying, let alone realize how absurd the statement is. So, now I\\u2019ve told you about the uselessness of reflection, it\\u2019s time to reflect on what I learned in 2018! I was originally going to use that Socrates quote to start this article and lecture you about the importance of looking backwards, before, in a plot twist, realizing it\\u2019s complete bunk. Fortunately, this about-face reinforces the one overarching idea I took away from 2018: we are all wrong about a lot of things a lot of the time, but, we can get less wrong. While some may view this conclusion pessimistically \\u2014 if we\\u2019re just going to be wrong, why learn anything at all? \\u2014 I see it as a great opportunity. Yes, we are currently wrong about many of our beliefs \\u2014 including our foundational ideas \\u2014 but that just means we have the chance to get less wrong as we go through life. As we accumulate experiences and learn from data, we can gain a more accurate worldview and, as we\\u2019ll see, it turns out that worldview is almost always more optimistic than we originally thought. To continue in my quest to get less wrong and because the end of the year is a time for lists, I\\u2019ve listed 30 things I learned in 2018 from books, podcasts, life, and other people. These aren\\u2019t meant to be absolute truths, and, I wouldn\\u2019t be surprised if a year from now I come back and correct the majority of these! I don\\u2019t claim these are the final beliefs I\\u2019ll hold the rest of my life, just what I currently believe. As the evidence and society changes, I\\u2019ll re-evaluate my positions to make sure they are still compatible with reality. I\\u2019ve listed the sources for these ideas in parenthesis and provided a link the first time a source appears. Books are in italics, \\u201cpodcasts or short works are in quotes\\u201d, and life is something I picked up through everyday experiences or from family, friends, co-workers, etc. As a glimpse into my ever-evolving worldview, this is more personal than what I usually write but as always, if you have criticisms, objections, or your own ideas, don\\u2019t hesitate to add a comment or write to me on Twitter! With that said, here\\u2019s what I learned in 2018: As always, I welcome feedback, discussion, and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Recently, this chart has started showing up in the news: Originally appearing in a Mother Jones article (original data for your own analysis), I have seen this chart accompanied by thoughts like \\u201cthanks e-cigarette companies for taking us back to the 1950s\\u201d or \\u201cI thought we already solved this problem but evil cigarette companies are back at it selling poison to our youth.\\u201d While there is nothing more appealing to humans than jumping on the moral outrage bandwagon, recently I\\u2019ve tried to stop myself from immediately falling in line by thinking rationally about where the blame for \\u201cbad\\u201d events should really be placed. If we take a minute to trace the actual source of these developments, we arrive at an answer both more mundane and more disturbing than our instinctual reaction has us believe. (I\\u2019m not in any way trying to downplay the problem of e-cigarette use. The data are alarming \\u2014 see for yourself \\u2014 and I am worried about the potential undoing of decades of progress in public health. My point in this article is to show that blaming an \\u201cother\\u201d gets us no closer to solving the problem.) Let\\u2019s start the blame seeking by considering who started this whole business in the first place: the cigarette companies. Philip Morris International (PMI) is one of the largest members of the worldwide cigarette market, with $67.7 billion in sales, nearly $8 billion in profit, and almost 20% market share. The answer for who to point the finger at is simple right? The ones on top must be held accountable, in this case, Louis Camilleri (Chairman) and Andr\\u00e9 Calantzopoulos (CEO). However, that\\u2019s not quite right, because even though the CEO and Chairman are the public faces of the company, they must report to the board of directors, so we need to shift the burden of guilt to its members (the faces of evil). Unfortunately, we can\\u2019t stop there. While the board may push for such evil tactics such as deliberately advertising to teens, as a publicly-held company, the board of Philip Morris International is elected by and answers to one group: the shareholders. What\\u2019s the problem you may ask? Only rich people hold stocks, and they are to blame for poisoning our youth you are tempted to shout. While I have no doubt some very wealthy individuals do own PMI stock, there is another group closer to home that holds a significant fraction of PMI. As a large, relatively stable company, Philip Morris stock is a safe option for long-term investments with little risk, which just happens to be what retirement account investment managers look for. Here\\u2019s the kicker: 3 of the most popular retirement mutual funds (measured by managed assets in 401k retirement plans) have substantial investments in Philip Morris International. We\\u2019ve traveled down the Yellow Brick Road of blame, pulled back the curtain on the wizard, and revealed that the ultimate responsibility for big tobacco, hundreds of millions of early deaths, and now, the rise in teen e-cig use is the workers and retirees of America. The next time you see an ad for e-cigarettes, be assured that it was paid for by your parents, your grandparents, and yes, even your hard-earned retirement money. The Vanguard Institutional, Fidelity 500, and American Funds EuroPacific Growth mutual funds hold hundreds of millions of dollars in PMI. Vanguard, the largest provider of mutual funds in the world is the single largest holder of Philip Morris International (yes, in case you are asking, my own retirement and personal investment accounts hold PMI within mutual and index funds). But wait you cry, hoping to at least distance yourself from the best-known purveyor of electronic cigarettes (and one of the worst offenders when it comes to advertising to children), Juul is privately owned! Well, on Thursday, December 19, Altria Group Incorporated (makers of family-friendly products such as Marlboro) spent $13 billion to acquire a 35% stake in Juul. But, you probably already knew that because you own Altria Group as part of your Vanguard or Fidelity mutual fund. Moreover, as a shareholder, you were probably thrilled at the news because it seems like a great investment! (Confusing matters, Altria Group Inc. was renamed from Philip Morris Companies in 2003 to disassociate the company from the negative name of Philip Morris in America. Philip Morris International is now a separate company and Philip Morris USA is part of Altria Group). Whenever we are confronted with a moral injustice, our immediate reaction is to search for someone to blame. Thanks to our natural tendency towards xenophobia (fear of outsiders) this is almost always an \\u201cother\\u201d, someone completely unlike our moral, upstanding selves. Let\\u2019s consider a typical example. Americans routinely report they think the world is getting more violent when all of the evidence shows the world is actually more peaceful now than ever before and continues to get less violent. When asked the reason for this discrepancy, most people will blame the news: \\u201cit\\u2019s the media portraying violence which distorts our view of the world\\u201d. It may be true the media (especially local news) focuses undue attention on negative events, but it\\u2019s not the media\\u2019s job to be objective. The media has one objective, to entertain the public, and apparently, people continue to be drawn to terrible stories despite a drastic decline in the number of bad events happening. The full responsibility for our corrupted worldview lies with us, the consumers of the media. If everyone suddenly demanded the media portray the world as it really is and watch the channels that did the best job of being objective, then the tenor of the news would rapidly change. Outrage and blaming of outsiders may be the natural response to moral trespasses, but just because something is natural does not make it right. Xenophobia, violence, and hatred may be some of our most natural tendencies, but no one (save the president of the United States) openly advocates for increased levels of these. Furthermore, blaming someone else prevents you from having to do anything because you are not responsible. In short, looking for somewhere to place blame \\u2014 for any situation, large or small \\u2014 is a temporarily satisfying but long-term disastrous tendency (blaming someone is different than searching for a cause that can be used to prevent the next occurrence of a disaster. The former is instinctual and is about not having to take responsibility while the latter is rational and aims to improve safety). In case you are despairing by this point, there is hope. If we can avoid the blame instinct, change can happen on both an individual level and societal level. Let\\u2019s look at the two scenarios outlined above: If you don\\u2019t like supporting cigarette companies via your retirement funds, you can manage your own retirement funds, or, as I\\u2019ve started to do, explore Socially Responsible Investing (SRI), Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investing, or impact investing, all of which take into account \\u201csocially beneficial\\u201d policies rather than mere profits (Swell Investing is one option). In a bit of positive news, ESG investing has exploded in popularity and now represents around $20 trillion in managed assets worldwide. Keep in mind that change is hard and requires tradeoffs. You may have to spend more time picking retirement funds and investigating company policies and accept a lower return. Real change doesn\\u2019t come without sacrifices. Furthermore, if you aren\\u2019t happy with the traditional media, there is nothing forcing you to turn on the TV or open CNN every day. Instead, you can read books such as The Better Angels of Our Nature; Enlightenment Now; and Factfulness, all of which take an objective look at the world and reach the inevitable conclusion that things are very good and continue to improve. Also, once you read these books, don\\u2019t hesitate to share the \\u201cgood news\\u201d with others. For some reason, people tend to talk to each other about negative events (which just make people more afraid) rather than positive realities such as the fact that 80% of children around the world have been vaccinated or that 80% of the world has access to electricity. Real face-to-face conversations actually do change minds \\u2014 just look at the extraordinary shift in public perception around gay marriage in the US if you think that people \\u2014 and by extension society \\u2014 can\\u2019t change. Some lessons you only learn when people are honest with you and so consider this my attempt to be straight: most of the terrible things that happen in the world are due to not malicious hidden actors but rather to the choices we make every single day. However, my point is not to make you feel worse about yourself; my overall message is positive: you don\\u2019t have to wait a minute for someone else to come along and improve the world, you can start right now. Not to get too philosophical on you, but when you\\u2019re looking for someone to blame, start by looking in a mirror. Once you\\u2019ve figured out where the real fault lies, start making small changes. You can only directly affect your own life, but by changing your actions, you change those around you and so on until you live in a country where anyone can marry who they choose or in a world where the global poverty rate has fallen by half in the past 20 years! Once we overcome the blame instinct, we can make the world better through the only power available to us: changing ourselves. This article is based on a similar idea expressed by the late Hans Rosling in his incredible book Factfulness: Ten Reasons We\\u2019re Wrong About the World \\u2014 and Why Things Are Better Than You Think. In his version, he concludes we can convince pharmaceutical companies to produce more malaria drugs for poor nations by punching our grandmothers. The book is an excellent objective look at the world and I highly recommend it as well as the GapMinder Project if you want to be less ignorant about the world). As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my website willk.online. Case Western Reserve University, my alma mater, is known by its students primarily for being everyone\\u2019s second choice. Case is slightly less prestigious than the Ivies or MIT, and almost all the students were there because they had not got into their first selection. The effects of this were noticeable: claiming we had no school spirit was an understatement. There was no pride in the university and the only unifying force was a desire to be somewhere else. The effects went beyond meager attendance at sporting events: it meant students spent four years \\u2014 supposedly the best in their lives \\u2014 wishing they were at a different school and regretting the choices that led them to Case. This phenomenon \\u2014 wanting to have made different decisions in the past, and, as a consequence, not enjoying where you currently are \\u2014 I call regretting the present. We hear people express a regret for the present constantly in statements such as \\u201cif only I had taken that other job\\u201d, \\u201cif only I had not married my spouse\\u201d, or \\u201cI always think of how happy I would be in another city.\\u201d These capture the same basic idea: somewhere along the line these individuals made a decision they wish they could correct and they know they would be better off if only they had chosen differently. Regretting the present is one of the most insidious mental exercises we can subject ourselves to. Not only do we criticize our past selves, we also disregard our current selves, and even project into the future by claiming that we will only keep making the same mistakes. The end effect is rather than concentrating on reality in front of us, we lose ourselves in self-deprecating fantasy lives we would have if only we had made different choices. Even at the age of 22, I have a long series of decisions I replay over and over in my head, imagining alternative scenarios. These range from conversations I was too nervous to start, activities I turned down because I had to work on homework, and of course, where I went to college. Recently, I\\u2019ve decided this has to stop; if I already have this many regrets, how will I be able to live with myself at 40 with another two decades of decisions behind me? There are no possible benefits to this constant criticism of my past decisions (this is decidedly different than objective reflection) and it means I am not fully invested in the present. What is my plan of attack? I\\u2019ve adopted a two-part mindset I remember whenever I start to replay past decisions: These are a little ephemeral, so let me explain my reasoning. From an evolutionary standpoint, I struggle to understand why we have a tendency to play out these fantasies of past decisions. It seems like in terms of survival, by definition, we wouldn\\u2019t have made it past the decisions we messed up, and, if we survived, then we made the right choice. Perhaps the problem is that now our bad choices don\\u2019t kill us (at least not immediately) leaving us plenty of time to mull over what we could have done differently. Although a bad choice doesn\\u2019t mean death (which is decidedly a good thing), it means we are stuck replaying and regretting our choices. Confounding the problem is the proliferation of choices in western society. As Barry Schwartz describes in his book The Paradox of Choice, we have created a society with a nearly unlimited number of options in all situations from the small \\u2014 which shampoo to purchase \\u2014 to the life-defining \\u2014 where to go to college and what to study. However, rather than leading to a utopia, the limitless choices have led to increased rates of depression and anxiety as well as decreased rates of life satisfaction. Schwartz provides copious evidence indicating that the more choices we have, the longer we take to make a decision and the greater the regret when we finally choose. This is particularly pronounced for us maximizers, those who want to get the absolute best in every situation. Compared to satisficers, who can do with the merely good, maximizers will spend an inordinate amount of time making and regretting decisions. Having identified my natural tendency to maximize, I have been trying to change into (somewhat of) a satisficer. I\\u2019ve been relatively successful in adopting the concept of \\u201cdon\\u2019t let the perfect be the enemy of the good.\\u201d This is evidenced by my ability to release articles with only two edits instead of four, and accepting work that is at 95% instead of spending double the time to get it to 100%. The next step is to take the same concept and apply it to making decisions. There will always be better choices leading to objectively superior situations, but the effort required to evaluate all the options means I am better off accepting a slightly less-optimal option and then not rethinking my decision. This is a satisficer\\u2019s way of looking at the world: there could be better choices out there, but once a decision has been made, they don\\u2019t matter anymore. Moreover, I have been trying to strike the very idea of good or bad choices from my mindset. Classifying a past choice as negative only serves to reinforce the idea that you could be in a better place and gives your brain the opening it needs to start constructing harmful imagined presents. Instead, every decision is simply a decision and we need to stop and appreciate where we are rather than thinking of where we could be. (There is something to be said for reflecting on what one might have done differently or drawing lessons from your past, but this becomes detrimental when we start passing judgment on our past selves. It\\u2019s one thing to say \\u201cmaybe if I went back I would have studied history instead of engineering,\\u201d but it has a different connotation when phrased as \\u201cI would be so much better off if I hadn\\u2019t been so naive and pursued a history degree instead.\\u201d The first is relatively neutral, while the second can only be harmful to your current self. ) The second strategy initially may seem morbid: end any sentence that begins: \\u201cIf only I had done\\u2026\\u201d with \\u201cI would have been hit by a bus.\\u201d Nonetheless, the point is not about the exact outcome, but rather that you don\\u2019t really know how things would have turned out had you made different decisions. While we like to think of events as a straightforward narrative, the real world is random, and a different past decision would just as likely lead to disaster as to success. There is a common fallacy, perpetrated by traditional history books, that certain outcomes are destined to happen and successful people were shaped just right by their lives to come out on top. The mistake is that these books are always looking backwards, and in hindsight, it\\u2019s very easy to draw a straight line through what was actually a random series of occurrences. This tendency to think in linear stories is known as the narrative fallacy and affects our thinking by convincing us outcomes are destined and cannot be changed. Reality laughs at this viewpoint: nearly everything in life, from who we marry to where we end up living, is ultimately random (see The Drunkard\\u2019s Walk: How Randomness Rules Our Lives). There is no coherent thread of events in the objective world until we look back and construct one. Why this matters is that the narrative fallacy leads us to imagine different paths for our lives that are straightforward, with us ending up exactly where we wanted (as if we know where that is). In spite of our strong beliefs, it is ridiculous to think things would play out anything like what we imagine. Any potential fantasy of a different series of life choices you dream up will be better than your current situation; that\\u2019s the definition of a fantasy. You\\u2019ll imagine a linear path from one good decision to the next, culminating in a dream existence with no worries. In reality, even if you had made all the right choices, there is still the chance you could start your dream job by walking out the door and into the maw of an errant mass transportation vehicle. That is just the randomness of life at work. Telling yourself that you would have been better off had you made different decisions is assuming that reality is linear and proceeds smoothly along a predestined path. The strategy here is simple: combat those tempting fantasies by ending them in disaster. When your mind starts revisiting past decisions and creates a rosier future, put a stop to it with a random event. I\\u2019m well aware that it\\u2019s easier to act yourself into a new way of thinking than to think yourself into a new way of acting. There is only so much (pretty much nothing) that mindlessly repeating a mantra can accomplish. To create lasting change, you need to put the ideas into practice. Part of my solution is right here: writing about my problem (thanks for listening). Writing forces you to think critically, and when I objectively examine my practice of regretting the present, I see that there are no benefits and that I am being irrational by constructing these straightforward stories of imagined success. (I\\u2019ve also started ending other people\\u2019s \\u201cI should have\\u201d sentences with \\u201cbut then I would have been hit with a bus.\\u201d This strategy is not advisable in all situations, but if anyone objects, tell them it\\u2019s for their own benefit.) What\\u2019s more, human memories are \\u2014 for better and for worse \\u2014 extremely malleable. Although I use to view my college experience \\u2014 both where I went to school and what I studied \\u2014 in a negative light there\\u2019s nothing stopping me from flipping the script. If I had gone to U Chicago (my first choice), I would have been a small fish in a very large pond and would not have had the chance to grow to love Cleveland. My degree, while not directly applicable to my current job, taught me how to solve challenges and gave me a background in mechanical properties, a useful skill in my data science role at Cortex Building Intelligence. While you should consider your decisions to be set in stone (the ability to reverse choices actually makes us regret them more), your memories don\\u2019t have to be. Instead of weaving a narrative about what you could have done, try taking what you did do and putting it in a positive light. Ultimately, there are always going to be many options, but you can only choose one, and those choices have led to a single present. There\\u2019s no use spending effort imaging a better present, and instead, appreciate your reality. I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my personal website willk.online. There\\u2019s a pervasive myth \\u2014 perhaps taught to you by an economics course \\u2014 that humans are rational. The traditional view is we objectively analyze the world, draw accurate conclusions, and make decisions in our best interest. While few people completely buy into this argument anymore, we are still often unaware of our cognitive biases, with the result that we vote, spend money, and form opinions based on a distorted view of the world. A recent personal experience where I badly misjudged reality \\u2014 due to cognitive illusions\\u2014 brought home this point and demonstrated the importance of fact-checking our views of the world. While this situation had no negative consequences, it was a great reminder that we are all subject to powerful biases and personal opinions are no substitute for checking the data. Shortly after moving to Boston, I thought I noticed a striking phenomenon: loads of people smoking. After a few days, it seemed to me that every street corner was filled with people lighting up cigarettes. Having come from a small midwestern town where it was exceedingly rare to see anyone smoking, I was dismayed: maybe the big city encouraged negative vices I would eventually pick up, or worse, smoking rates were on the rise nationwide. While a few decades ago I would have had no option but to either persist in this belief or painstakingly look for demographic data in a library, now I was able to find verified data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention within seconds. To my surprise, and dealing a large blow to my rational view of myself, I found the following table comparing smoking rates in the metro area nearest my small town (Peoria, IL) to those in Boston: Not only was I wrong, I was significantly wrong as indicated by the non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. (Although we tend to focus on a single number, considering uncertainty estimates is crucial especially when dealing with real-world demographic data). To show visually how wrong I was, even accounting for the uncertainty, I made the following smoking rate boxplots: Why was I so wrong? I\\u2019m a firm believer in analyzing your mistakes so you don\\u2019t make them again and, in this process, I came up with three reasons: These are all examples of cognitive biases \\u2014 mistakes in reasoning and deviations from rational decision making \\u2014 or heuristics \\u2014 mental shortcuts (rules of thumb) we use to quickly make judgements. While these served us well in our evolutionary past, they often fail us in today\\u2019s world. We are now required to process many streams of information with complex interacting factors and our fast intuitions are not adapted for this purpose. (For the definitive reference on cognitive biases and how to overcome them, read Daniel Kahnemann\\u2019s masterwork Thinking, Fast and Slow. A less intimidating format for learning these is the You Are Not So Smart Podcast). One of the simplest ways to correct for our innate shortcomings is to fact-check ourselves. Especially in an age with so much accurate information freely available there is no excuse for persisting in false beliefs. Instead of reasoning from personal experience/anecdotes, look up the actual numbers! Moreover, in addition to just figuring out the right answer, it\\u2019s important to think about why we erred. We\\u2019re never going to rid ourselves of cognitive biases, but we can learn to recognize when they occur and how to overcome them. For example, I should have noticed the people who weren\\u2019t smoking (the denominator), or thought about the total number of people I see in my small town every day compared to the number of people I observed in Boston. Building on that last point, while looking at data by itself is useful, trying to understand what it means in the context of your life can be more helpful. This is where some statistics and basic data manipulation can go a long way. On an average day in my home town, I probably saw about 50 people walking around (okay no one walks in the Midwest but stay with me) compared to Boston with maybe 100 times as many at 5,000. Knowing the smoking rate and the total number of people I expect to see, I simulated 10,000 days to find out how many smokers I would expect to see on a day in Boston versus my hometown. (Jupyter Notebook available on GitHub). Even though my hometown has a statistically greater proportion of smokers, in terms of raw numbers, on an average day, I\\u2019d see about 100 times the number of smokers in Boston. These graphs, coupled with my neglect of the denominator, show why I was so susceptible to the availability heuristic. While this small example is innocuous, the general impact of our biases is pervasive and often detrimental. For instance, because of a predominantly negative news cycle (manifesting in the availability heuristic), people generally think the world is getting worse. If fact, by almost all objective measures, we are living at the best time in human history and things are improving. (All graphs from Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker). This has real-world implications: people vote for leaders who promise a return to better times because they haven\\u2019t looked at the data and realized the best time is now! Moving away from politics, think about your personal life: is there a relationship you\\u2019ve spent too long in, a negative job you\\u2019ve stuck with, or even a book you continue reading despite not enjoying? Then you\\u2019ve fallen victim to the Sunk-Cost Fallacy, where we continue squandering time on an endeavor because of the effort we\\u2019ve already put in. As another example, if you find yourself worrying about air travel, instead of reading about the miniscule number of plane crashes, look at the data showing flying is the safest way to travel. I\\u2019ve tried to adopt two simple rules for myself to mitigate cognitive biases: Following these guidelines won\\u2019t make me perfect, but they are helping me gradually become less wrong. I don\\u2019t believe there\\u2019s always one objective truth, but I do think facts are much better than our subjective judgements. To end this article on a happy note, here\\u2019s a graph showing the decline in smoking rates in the United States (despite my misbelief)! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my website at willk.online. The three traits that turn ordinary people into modern superheroes It turns out Hollywood was right all along. Besides making great documentaries about space like The Martian, movie studios are also remarkably on point about superheroes. They just got the powers real people use to transform into legends slightly wrong. Rather than flight or invincibility, real superheroes share three traits: Take Elon Musk, founder and/or CEO of PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, SolarCity, Neuralink, and the Boring Company with a net worth north of $20 billion. How was Musk able to create Tesla, the first successful American car startup in over one hundred years which, at times, has been worth more than GM despite selling less than 1/100 the number of cars? How was he able to start and keep alive SpaceX, a private spaceflight company that started out with three disastrous failures? Simple: Musk used all of these superpowers better than other any human alive. If you cannot teach yourself, then you will only learn from others and will be limited to what they want you to know. Autodidacticism, the ability to educate yourself, frees you from the constraints of a traditional education. Conventional studies tend to focus on a narrow topic. This severely limits career flexibility and innovation potential of those who cannot learn on their own. As Steven Johnson points out in his book Where Good Ideas Come From, all significant innovations have come from connections between fields, not from deep within a specific field. This blurring of boundaries is called the \\u201cadjacent possible\\u201d, and is created by the ability to cross from one topic to another, a trait not instilled in us by structured education. Further, we corner ourselves into a specific career definition because we focus on a single topic in school and do not feel comfortable trying to learn a new subject. Change is difficult, and we tell ourselves we can\\u2019t leave an awful job because we don\\u2019t know anything different. This not only makes you a terrible conversation partner (trust me, no one wants to hear the particulars of your mechanical engineering education at dinner), it also means you will be stuck working for others in unsatisfactory conditions your entire life. Education, specifically self-education, is the best way to ensure you get to live life on your terms. Musk, a business and physics major by training, took this lesson by heart. There was nothing in his college education that would have prepared him to start an online payments company, a rocket company, or an electric vehicle company. Musk has never been constrained by his education. Instead of backing away from the challenge of starting a rocket company despite knowing little rocket science, he defined his goal and then devoted himself to a study of aerospace engineering. He also surrounded himself with the brightest individuals in the field, demonstrating that a necessary part of self education is never being the smartest person in the room. By teaching himself what school would not, Musk was able to learn enough to figure out how to get stuff into space cheaper than anyone else \\u2014 and build a multi-billion dollar company in the process. If Musk becomes the first man to set foot on Mars, it won\\u2019t be because a professor taught him how to get there in class. Musk\\u2019s autodidacticism allowed him to create his companies, but his ability to convince people these businesses would prosper is what has allowed them to succeed. When Musk first announced the Tesla Model 3, over 500,000 people deposited $1000 for the opportunity to buy a car they hadn\\u2019t seen in person and wouldn\\u2019t be delivered for years. Tesla conducted no mass-marketing sales campaign, they merely gave Musk a stage and he did the rest. While Musk\\u2019s talks are not the polished deliveries of business school classes, he makes up for it with his exceptional portrayal of the future. He is persuasive because he sells not products, but a vision of utopia that will be obtained only by buying into his companies. Painting a vision of the future was a tactic also employed by another extraordinary CEO (and great salesman), the late Steve Jobs. Numerous companies developed mobile phones and tablets before the iPhone or iPad, but only Jobs was able to convince us we actually needed them. His speech announcing the first iPhone in 2007 makes the smartphone seem extraordinary even today. People do not willingly adopt a new argument based solely on its merits, you have to show them that your idea will improve their lives and is something they can\\u2019t live without. Writing clearly and persuasively is another critical aspect of achieving superhuman power. Think of a physicist. Who was the first person to come to mind? Probably Stephen Hawking or Neil DeGrasse Tyson, not because they are the most brilliant in their field, but because they have the best public outreach. Some people take the length of a work to be the measure of sophistication, but in fact, it's the opposite: those who can communicate their ideas in the shortest amount of time or words best understand those ideas. A study conducted at Princeton showed people rate papers with understandable words as more intelligent than papers with long, complex words. Moreover, they were more likely to accept the author\\u2019s ideas when they were presented in clear language. As the studies author\\u2019s conclude: \\u201cAll in all, the effect is extremely robust: needless complexity leads to negative evaluations\\u201d. Great speakers and writers aim for the fewest words with the greatest impact. Whenever I write or speak I think of the following single word: There is no better summary of how to communicate. When I say you need to be technically literate, I do not mean you need to understand how to build your own computer. A simple knowledge of how to make things easier with the appropriate tools can make you seem like a genius. While interning at NASA, I saw the country\\u2019s smartest individuals literally doing rocket science in Excel. I knew a little Python (a common coding language), and building on some code I copied from the internet, I was able to automate colleagues\\u2019 tasks and save them hundreds of hours. Instantly, I was transformed from a lowly intern into the hero of my division. Technical literacy is often not about inventing an answer from scratch, but rather adopting an existing solution to fit your problem. Our two model CEOs were no strangers to the idea of building upon tech that already existed. Apple was successful by creating a user-friendly product and acting at the right time when the technology \\u2014 the PC, the smartphone, or the iPad \\u2014 had matured to the point that anyone could figure it out. Often, the inventor of a technology does not reap the benefits because they are too early or do not see the potential applications. Finding ways to implement an invention is often more important than developing the idea. Musk did not create the internet or online commerce, but he was able to take advantage of existing platforms to found his first successful venture, PayPal. One doesn\\u2019t need to understand neural networks or artificial intelligence to be a tech wizard. Often, just being able to get a computer working by turning it off and on will win you immense adoration. One of the principles of technical literacy is to solve the problem using the easiest solution. Making a useful calendar with reminders does not require machine learning, only Google and a few minutes of tinkering. Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, and with a little trial and error, we can harness it for that purpose. While Musk and Jobs demonstrated all three traits, you don\\u2019t need to master all three to become a productive member of society. Simply keep these superpowers in mind as you go through daily actions. The next time you want to learn a topic, don\\u2019t look first at a list of college courses, but consider if you can teach it to yourself, preferably with real examples. If you have to give a presentation, work on making your point with as few slides as possible and try writing cogent emails. Finally, don\\u2019t be intimidated by our digital world and understand we control our technology. By harnessing these superpowers you might not get a movie made about you (although Jobs did), but you will be better equipped to construct a life on your own terms and shape the world to your liking.

A five-minute primer Recently, I found myself in a conversation with a global warming skeptic who said she was willing to change her mind if only someone could give her a five-minute explanation of how climate change worked. I opened my mouth to list all the stats and tell her 97% of climate scientists believe in human-caused global warming, but then I thought better of it. She had probably heard these arguments multiple times and wanted an explanation and not more talk about parts per million of carbon dioxide or potential sea level rise 100 years from now. Moreover, I realized that despite being a firm believer in human-caused global warming and an advocate for action, I didn\\u2019t actually know how the science worked. This was quite an embarrassing situation and I set out to form my own five-minute explanation. Instead of countering denier\\u2019s arguments with endless facts, I want to be able to walk them through the science and show that climate change is not an overly complex theory that only a handle of elite scientists can understand. In the process of forming my own explanation, I was reminded once again that you really don\\u2019t understand a topic until you have to explain it to others! Our atmosphere is composed of many gases that interact with light in different ways. All gases allow some energy from the sun (in the form of visible light) to pass through and reach the surface of the Earth. The Earth absorbs and then re-emits this energy as infrared radiation, which some gases, namely carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H20), and methane (CH4), partially block from passing back into space. Instead, these \\u201cgreenhouse\\u201d gases reflect the infrared radiation in all directions, including back towards the Earth increasing the temperature of the planet. This is what people are talking about when they say \\u201cgreenhouse effect.\\u201d The greenhouse effect is a natural process, and, without our atmosphere, the temperature of the Earth would be about 0 F. The temperature our planet fluctuates as the concentration of gases in the atmosphere changes. Historical observations show that as carbon dioxide levels increase, temperature also rises because of an increased greenhouse effect. In fact, we know that temperatures have been higher (and much lower) in the past than they are now! Nature is very good at self-regulating and when the climate undergoes a sustained shift in one direction , there are natural mechanisms that will eventually push it the other way. However, about 150 years ago, humans entered the climate picture when we began extracting energy from oil, coal, and natural gas. Even as a proponent for climate activism, I admit these sources of fuels have been an incredible short-term benefit to humanity, powering the high-quality of life we enjoy today. Nevertheless, looking only at the immediate payoffs obscures the downsides of fossil fuels, namely the pollution, such as carbon dioxide, that results from burning them. Levels of carbon dioxide rise and fall naturally over time, changes that we can measure from ice cores drilled at the Poles. These are processes that would occur with or without humans on Earth and climate cycles are a historical fact. However, what distinguishes the past 150 years is the incredibly rapid increase in carbon dioxide levels. Based on past observations that temperatures rise with an increase in carbon dioxide and our knowledge of the greenhouse effect, we can conclude that increasing levels of carbon dioxide from using fossil fuels will lead to an increase in global temperatures. From the historical records, we also know that elevated temperatures cause sea levels to increase, storms to be more severe, and distributions of plant and animals species to change dramatically. I have to mention that the magnitude of these changes is very uncertain. Among climate scientists, the debate over human-caused global warming has been settled, but any reputable scientist will admit the possible effects cannot be exactly predicted. Some areas of the globe could even benefit, but overall, it is in our best interest to decrease the rate of change so we are able to adequately adapt. When explaining technical concepts, I like to emphasis that science is a human endeavor. Science is not a faceless institution that issues statements for its own benefits. Rather, it is a collection of diverse individuals all of whom genuinely try to use the scientific method to improve the world. Moreover, there are rigorous discussions about every scientific concept that are left out of the media summary of current findings. In the case of climate science, there was plenty of debate \\u2014 Svante Arrhenius first proposed that burning fossil fuels would lead to temperature increases in 1896, and as late as the 1990s there were still mainstream doubts about the role of humans in global warming. However, there is now overwhelming agreement that humans are causing the climate to change. All the scientists I have spoken to are concerned not with enriching their own bank account, but in helping us to collectively address this problem. I think my generation (the \\u2018lazy\\u2019 millennials) need a crisis to bring us together, and there is no more monumental challenge than addressing climate change. The first step in solving any problem is admitting we have one, and taking the five minutes to explain how global warming works to someone who is not yet convinced will allow us to move beyond arguing and start taking action. A great free online resource for learning about climate change is Skeptical Science. For anyone wanting a readable introduction to climate change the best book to start with is Elizabeth Kolbert\\u2019s Field Notes from a Catastrophe. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached at wjk68@case.edu When I\\u2019m wrong, call me out! Here\\u2019s a radical idea: every time you refrain from correcting someone out of politeness, you are doing them a disservice by robbing them of a valuable opportunity for self-improvement. Lately, I have noticed a disconcerting trend: people in daily life are more reluctant to point out and correct other\\u2019s mistakes. This has been most pronounced than in the classroom where it seems to be impossible for a student to actually give a wrong answer. Instead, they are \\u201con the right track\\u201d or \\u201chave the basic concept\\u201d no matter how far away from the correct response they actually are. Now, I understand professors may not want to discourage a student by flat out telling them they are wrong, but despite recent political developments in the US, we are not living in a post-truth world. There are still right and wrong answers, optimal ways to solve a problem, and opinions that belong in \\u201cthe dustbin of history.\\u201d The aversion to correcting false statements extends beyond the classroom. In my time with NASA, I sat in on many meetings where a manager said something all the engineers knew was technically wrong, but no one would ever think to speak up and point this out. Afterwards, we talked about how the manager had no clue how things actually got done, but instead of explaining that to him, we let him continue in his false beliefs. As a final example, consider a typical scenario in the early rounds of the popular singing contest American Idol: a young contestant, full of enthusiasm and confidence walks onto the stage and belts out an absolutely unbearable rendition of a pop song. How on Earth did they come to believe they had any singing talent? Because no one had ever been told them how bad they really were. For years, they had been surrounded by family and friends who politely told them they were a great performer, a delusion that finally was shattered in front of a national audience. All it would have taken was a single honest person to tell the contestant that maybe they should pursue a different path to save them hours of wasted effort and the embarrassment of a failed audition. What is the driving force behind the criticism decline? The answer has two parts. First, the powerful inertia of the status quo prevents people from taking action to step up and make a correction. It takes considerable effort to not only point out a falsehood, but then to patiently explain to someone why they are incorrect. We are all so absorbed in our own lives and problems that dealing with others\\u2019 issues can be overwhelming. It\\u2019s much easier to just let the mistake slide and continue on with the conversation or meeting rather than be \\u201cthat\\u201d person who has to make a fuss. The problem with this mindset is that progress only happens by going against the status quo. It\\u2019s the disruptive individuals and companies that end up having the greatest influence as opposed to those who sit silently and let dismal conditions persist. \\u201cThat\\u201d person who speaks up may seem obnoxious, but I would argue that any company should seek out those individuals who are not afraid to challenge standard operating procedure. The unwillingness of people at large companies to go against the grain, has been given the name, \\u201cthe culture of complacency,\\u201d and has been blamed for numerous disasters, including the BP Gulf of Mexico oil spill and the crash of Korean Air 801. Societal advances are made not through passivity, but by those people who look at the current way of doing something and think \\u201cthat could be done more efficiently.\\u201d Mindlessly agreeing with a manager or co-workers is admittedly easier than correcting them, but it will never lead to meaningful change. The second aspect of the criticism decline is our own feelings of vulnerability. We believe that if we point out the mistakes of others, then others will be inclined to mention our own shortcomings. It is admittedly very difficult to open ourselves to criticism, even when we know how often we are wrong. I expect to be questioned when I give a presentation, but my initial internal reaction to any correction is still extremely negative. We all have built complex representations of the world in our heads, and when one part is challenged, it can feel as if the whole edifice may crumble. When we think about correcting someone else, we start to wonder if our own viewpoint could be wrong as well. What if our correction of the initial mistake is itself corrected by someone else? Or, even worse, what if someone questions one of the foundations of our worldview and forces us to think critically about our viewpoints? The issue with this line of thinking is that it implicitly suggests that being exposed to our own failures is a negative. I would argue this is actually one of the most valuable opportunities we are given. It is through making mistakes and learning from them that the most rapid self-improvement occurs. Yes, when we correct someone else, we open ourselves up to correction, but that is actually something to strive for rather than avoid. What Can be Done? We need to approach the problem from two directions: not only must we overcome our hesitation towards delivering constructive criticism, but we need to get better at responding when it is directed towards our ideas. The best way to shift our mindset with regards to the latter part of the problem is thinking about the following: we only make progress by learning from mistakes, however, making blunders can only be painful and time-consuming. Wouldn\\u2019t it be great if we could learn from failures without having to actually go through them ourselves? Well, that is exactly what happens when someone corrects us. If someone can see that we are on the path to messing something up because they themselves have done the exact same thing, then it is in our best interest to listen to them rather than carry through on our intended course of action. One individual can only make so many mistakes, but by learning from those of others, we can expand the effective number of experiences to which we are exposed. Think about Amazon reviews: rather than buy inferior products ourselves, we can rely on other\\u2019s experiences and purchase only the one item that has been tested and approved by hundreds of other people. Experience and knowledge should not be kept to each individual, but rather shared among a group. That ultimately is the benefit of working with others: rather than having to learn everything firsthand, we can use the collective knowledge of those around us to solve our problems. Then, when we make a mistake, we contribute what we learned back to the group and the entire knowledge base we can draw from grows. The single best way to get better at accepting criticism is to surround yourself with people who are smarter than you. If you ever think that you are the smartest person in the room, then you need to move. This semester, I have been fortunate to work as an undergrad in a research lab with a number of grad students with much more experience than me. At first, I tried to keep quiet out of fear of being exposed as naive, but eventually I gained the confidence to speak up after I saw even the post-docs were routinely corrected. Soon, I was benefiting enormously from the: make a mistake \\u2014 receive constructive feedback \\u2014 improve methods cycle. I have come to embrace the limits of my knowledge and I try to learn as much as possible from the previous experiences of others. In particular, I enjoy receiving feedback from one post-doc who is well, a little blunt in her criticism. At first, her style was off-putting, but once I realized she was only trying to help, I started to seek out her opinions. Now, I often send her my work with the explicit instructions to be as harsh as possible, an assignment in which she takes particular delight. This technique of intentionally opening yourself up to recurring criticism now even has a name: \\u201crejection therapy,\\u201d which falls under the general psychological principle of classical conditioning. The idea is that by repeatedly exposing ourselves to failure on purpose, we can start to view failures as a normal course of life and not disastrous setbacks. As society is becoming more failure-averse, there is a growing recognition of the need for making constructive mistakes. To be better receivers of criticism we need to shift our view of mistakes from entirely negative, to frustrating in the short-term, but a long term positive investment. The other half of addressing the criticism decline is learning how to give constructive feedback. There are any number of ways to tell someone they are incorrect, from the straight-up \\u201cthat\\u2019s wrong\\u201d to the round-about \\u201cwell, maybe, perhaps you don\\u2019t quite have everything quite right.\\u201d The correct method of delivery depends on the audience and sometimes it\\u2019s necessary to know when to exercise restraint. A recent situation presented me with a conundrum that I am still not sure I correctly resolved. I was at a talk by a Google employee on the subject of impostor syndrome, where you finally get that dream position, but then feel like you really don\\u2019t belong and that at any time, someone might point it out. This is a serious subject that prevents many people who are underrepresented in a field from even trying to get a position because they feel as if they won\\u2019t be accepted. The presenter shared several methods for overcoming impostor syndrome which she said had worked for her. One of these was \\u201cpower poses\\u201d, or the idea that you gain confidence by adopting certain stances such as standing with your hands on your hips at a meeting. The beneficial effects of power poses had been written up in a journal article and one of the authors had given a TED talk which has since been viewed almost 45 million times. However, I had recently read an article from another of the original authors who took back all the results of the study and said that she did not believe power poses actually work. Further studies had also failed to prove any benefits to \\u201cpower poses.\\u201d The presenter mentioned the original journal article as proof these poses worked, and I was faced with the question of whether or not to interrupt her and point out the flaws in the study and the debate over the results. In the end, I decided not to because I thought it would distract from her main message. After the talk I went to the presenter and told her about the recent developments concerning the study. We ended up having a good discussion on the reproducibility crisis in the social sciences (about 40% of study results cannot be replicated), and I thought I handled the situation well. However, I still wonder if I should have pointed out the debate over the study so everyone in the audience could hear the entire story. I am not making an argument for seeking out as many opportunities as possible to tell people they are wrong. However, when you encounter an obvious false statement or inefficient solution to a problem, feel free to speak up. Don\\u2019t be afraid to be that disruptive person at a meeting, because you may prevent the next Gulf of Mexico oil spill, or find a way to make a process twice as efficient. In the end, remember both when receiving and giving criticism, it is always the idea and not the person that is incorrect. Disagreements lead to far more progress than mindless acceptance of the status quo, and people are often willing to change their methods if you will have a reasoned discussion with them. Learn to associate criticism not with negativity, but with an opportunity for improvement and start to enjoy the benefits of shared knowledge and experiences. In that spirit, if anything I have written in this post, or any other post, or anything I say in real-life is wrong, do me a favor and let me know! Overcoming Social Anxiety with an Attitude Change Going into college I had a serious case of social anxiety. From conversations with classmates, I know I wasn\\u2019t the only one suffering from this problem, although everyone\\u2019s fears took different forms. My anxiety manifested itself whenever I had to start a conversation either in person or online. A typical example occurred when I would need to email professors to apply for a research position or just to ask for help. Every time, I would spend a few agonizing hours composing the ideal paragraph only to receive a reply within minutes saying simply \\u201cYes\\u201d with the tag \\u201cSent from my iPhone.\\u201d Inevitably, I would brief a sigh of relief and tell myself next time I would remember the professor would only spend a few seconds on my email and it did not have to be perfect. I knew that whenever I would read an email, I did not analyze every word and others were not expecting immaculate messages. Nevertheless, the next time I had to write a dreaded email, I would forget my promise and waste precious time crafting a message. Debilitating social stumbling blocks such as this affect all of us to some degree because we have a natural aversion to situations where we might be subjected to social disapproval. This makes perfect sense from an evolutionary standpoint \\u2014 we would not want to be alienated from a group when we depend on them for survival \\u2014 but it does not serve us well in the modern world where we must expose ourselves to rejection in multiple interactions every day. Even though one of my goals after high school was to embrace failure rather than trying to avoid it, I knew that social anxiety led me to avoid trying new opportunities because I was afraid of any form of rejection. Although I was able to identify this condition before my freshman year, it was not until my junior year that I was able to overcome it by embracing the mindset of \\u201cthe worst they can say is no.\\u201d This attitude is best illustrated with a personal example. My junior year, I had a thermodynamics class with a particularly stubborn professor. A former astronaut in training (he trained for 2 years as a back-up but never flew), he was known to spend an entire lecture discussing the intricacies of sailing because some topic, say surface friction, had reminded him of a decades-old experience. He would then end the lecture by assigning homework and telling us that since he was out of time, we would just have to refer to the book to learn any topics he was supposed to have covered. His first day message was: \\u201cI am not here to teach you, because you should learn everything on your own from the book while doing homework.\\u201d This is not unusual for a college course, but there was a slight catch in this particular class. The book that the professor was referring to had gone out of print 5 years beforehand and only a few used copies were offered on Amazon starting at $500. Moreover, there was no ebook that could be acquired, even through questionably legal methods. While several students shelled out the money for the book in the hope that they would be able to sell it at the end of the semester, I balked at the price. Even after the professor was told was this book was nearly impossible to obtain, he refused to change the textbook and said simply \\u201cshare one book with five people. That\\u2019s $100 each. That\\u2019s the price of a pair of shoes except the book is more useful.\\u201d After looking through every resource available (friends, the library, the entire Internet), I decided to put the motto of \\u201cthe worst they can say is no\\u201d into practice. I searched for the author of the book, found his school email, and sent him a message explaining the situation and asking if it would be possible for him to sell a digital copy of his book. My reasoning was that surely the book had been digitally designed and it would have to be relatively easy to make it available for purchase. A few hours after hitting send, I received the completely unexpected but welcome reply: \\u201cSend me your address and I will have a copy of the book in the mail tomorrow.\\u201d I offered to at least pay for the shipping, but I could not convince the author to accept any money. All he wanted was a promise I would not sell the book after the semester. I assured him that it would be passed on through several years of engineers (assuming that the professor would never change his ways). A few days later, the book showed up in the mail with a nice message from the author. After I put it through its paces, it is currently in the hands of another engineer about to take the same class, with the same professor, using the same book. This story serves not to brag about my ability to talk my way into a free book, but to demonstrate the effectiveness of \\u201cthe worst they can say is no\\u201d mentality. Before putting this attitude into practice, I would never have done something as crazy as emailing an unknown professor asking for a copy of his book, even though it took only 5 minutes of my time and saved me hundreds of dollars. My anxiety would have been too great and prevented me from hitting send. I won\\u2019t guarantee that this particular application will work every time (although to be honest I\\u2019ve only tried it once) but the general principle that you might as well ask has been a game-changer in my college career. Since this exchange, I no longer agonize over emails to professors (I do still check for spelling though) and I have improved at applying the same concept in person. Anytime I am presented with an opportunity that holds a chance for rejection, I remind myself that the worst case scenario is simply \\u201cno.\\u201d Even receiving a no can be a chance to improve one\\u2019s self if it is followed up with the question \\u201cWhat can I do better next time?\\u201d Applying for a job, trying for a raise, or contacting a professor for help can seem intimidating, but there is no consequence to asking, and not asking could be a major source of regret. I look back on many chances I have missed , but there are very few experiences that I have agreed to that I would take back. Memorizing a saying like \\u201cthe worst they can say is no\\u201d will never solve your problems, but it can serve as that extra confidence needed to get you to hit the send button or start a conversation. This outlook is particularly relevant to those students heading back to college because you will be exposed to more opportunities than at any other point in your life and you will need to constantly reach out for advice. Although from an evolutionary viewpoint, our inclination to hesitate in social situations could have served us well, that does not mean that we have to accept the default response (xenophobia may be natural, but we should still do everything in our power to combat it). Although some traits may have benefited us in the past, we need to realize that we can suppress harmful innate (or learned) responses and develop more sensible reactions for modern conditions. \\u201cThe worst they can say is no\\u201d is an effective message that can be used to overcome natural social anxieties and anyone heading off to college or hesitating when applying for a new opportunity should embrace this attitude change. A Review of Sapiens by Yuval Harari One-sentence summary: The history of humanity is best viewed as three revolutions: the cognitive revolution beginning 70,000 years ago characterized by the development of language; the agricultural revolution that began 12,000 years ago and led to the first permanent settlements enabled by large-scale cooperation; and the scientific revolution which commenced around 1600 when the modern ideals of humanism, liberalism and democracy were first adopted and technological progress began its exponential path. It\\u2019s perfectly acceptable if you graduated from high school with no desire to ever pick up a history book again. The endless listing of names and dates typical of the American history curriculum is incredibly effective at driving any enthusiasm for studying the past out of students. My knowledge of history post-high school consisted of a jumbled mix of (entirely American) names and events (Betsy Ross wrote the Constitution right?). The few times I went so far as to begin a history book since then, I have felt my mind shut down at the first mention of a name-date-event combination. I enjoy books with bold ideas, those that examine trends and try to explain movements, rather than those that get mired in the endless details of who exactly did what when. Some history books seem like they are on the verge of stepping back and looking at the big picture only to zoom right back in and lose the forest in a thicket of trees. I like the sound of studying the past to learn from our mistakes, but when the past is presented in list form, it can be pretty hard to take away anything relevant. Therefore, I was excited if somewhat skeptical when I heard about Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind, a book with an idea no less grand than the entire story of humanity, from our first upright steps on the African Savannah 2 million years ago to this very day (and even slightly into the future). The fact that the book seeks to explain central driving themes of human progress gave me hope that this would be a history book that eschewed traditional formats. Another fault of history as it is conventionally taught is that is gives the appearance that the past is linear, with one foregone conclusion leading to another, often driven by a single character (the \\u201cGreat Man\\u201d fallacy). Sapiens, written by Israeli history professor Yuval Harari, demonstrates instead that the past was full of innumerable diverging paths with never any guarantee of forward progress in one direction. It is constructive to view history through the overall trends that enable these different possibilities and to try and understand how we have changed biologically, socially, and morally during each of these periods. The choice of any dividing era of history will always be arbitrary, but Harari chooses a handy (and easily remembered) breakdown into three ages: the cognitive revolution, agricultural revolution, and scientific revolution. Harari has taken on a task with an ambitious scope, but by replacing names and dates with bold ideas, has succeeded in creating a highly readable account of how we got to this point (and where we might be heading). The Cognitive Revolution Our tale begins with an interesting question that few of us have likely considered: why are we, Homo sapiens, (Latin meaning \\u201cwise man\\u201d) the only still-living species in the genus Homo? (Brief note: a species is the most specific form of taxonomic classification for an organism, while genus is one step up the ladder. Organisms within the same species can mate and produce fertile offspring while species in the same genus are similar but not exact genetic matches). The genus Canis (\\u201cdog\\u201d) for example contains numerous species as diverse as domestic dogs, wolves, coyotes, and dingoes. We know for a fact that many other species of humans walked the Earth at one time, from the first Homo habilis (\\u201chandy man\\u201d) that appeared around 2.1 million years ago to Homo neanderthalensis which went extinct a mere 40,000 years ago (I\\u2019ll use the convention established by Harari of referring to members of the genus Homo as humans and the species sapiens as sapiens). The two plausible options for our current single species situation are interbreeding and extermination. Either sapiens thoroughly mixed with other human species to the point where they were assimilated into a single species, or our ancestors wiped the other members of the Homo genus off the Earth. As is often the case, the truth is likely somewhere between the two extremes. Recent studies have shown that modern humans in Europe and the Middle East share 1\\u20134% of their unique human DNA with Neanderthals. It may not seem like a large amount, but it is enough to irrevocably prove that sapiens and neanderthalensis interbred to some extent. While this is intriguing in and of itself for the complex dynamics that it suggests \\u2014 what would a meeting between two species of ancient humans look like? Were these inter-species relationships forbidden or encouraged? \\u2014 the more interesting conundrum is that archaeological evidence suggests that sapiens was neither the smartest nor the most physically capable of the Homo genus. How then did sapiens manage to survive when all other of our brethren did not? The best theory to explain the endurance of sapiens is that individually our species was not better adapted to survive, but collectively, sapiens was far more capable than any other Homo species. This early sapien collaboration was enabled by language, in particular, language that could explain abstract concepts not grounded in concrete reality. Abstract concepts provide the difference between saying \\u201cthere is a lion over there, we should watch out right now\\u201d to \\u201cthere is a lion over there, perhaps we should build a fence to protect ourselves in the future.\\u201d The fence and the future do not yet exist, but it is the ability to imagine that they do so and to take actions reflecting the possible future reality that set sapiens apart. Human\\u2019s advantage over other animals was enabled by an ability to master our environment through the creation of tools and by using resources beyond their primary value (eating a piece of fruit from a bush is extracting the primary value of the fruit; shaping a rock into an arrowhead is a secondary use of the rock) while sapiens\\u2019 advantage over other humans arose because of developments in the speech region of the brain. Improved communication capabilities allowed for planning and the spreading of beneficial innovations between individuals. Archaeological finds suggest that while some members of Homo used the same basic ax for over a million years \\u2014 can you imagine a smartphone model that does not improve for millennia? \\u2014 while sapiens constantly developed new iterations of tools, such spears that made it possible to attack an enemy from a distance. The cognitive enhancements were not dedicated solely to the warfare. Early sapiens also formed the first cultures and began making objects that served an aesthetic in addition to functional purpose. While none of these concepts presented in the book are groundbreaking, they are presented in a broader context that lets readers see how the details of a particular evolution feature affected the success of our species. Furthermore, it is possible to extrapolate these findings to the present day; these trends suggest that today we should promote exactly those features that made our early ancestors so capable as a collective. Laws that prohibit free communication and policies that prevent the spread of information inhibit the very advantages that allowed us to attain our privileged position as the sole representatives of Homo on the planet. The Agricultural Revolution and Shared Myths The tale of humanity begins to take off with the first permanent settlements near modern-day Israel and Jordan about 12,000 years ago. Contrary to popular perception of the agricultural revolution as a great step forward in average living standards, Harari paints a much darker picture calling agriculture \\u201cHistory\\u2019s biggest fraud.\\u201d What could possibly be negative about settling down for a life of guaranteed sustenance in a village surrounded by other humans? Well, for starters, work hours increased after the development of farming. Raising crops is unsurprisingly labor-intensive, and early farmers had 12 or more hours of back-breaking work to look forward to each day, as opposed to hunter-gatherers who could expect to spend about 4\\u20136 hours on an average day foraging for nutrition. Even modern humans living in societies with 40-hour work weeks spend more hours supporting themselves than did hunter-gatherers. Moreover, the type of work involved with agriculture was repetitive and mentally tedious compared with the problem-solving and varied environments encountered in a hunting lifestyle. Studies of pre-historic anatomies suggests that humans living in the first permanent settlements were physically much smaller than their hunter-gatherer relatives, indicating that the quality of nutrition actually decreased after we began raising our own crops (Harari points out that it is more accurate to say that corn and wheat domesticated humans rather than the other way around because crops forced us to settle in one place). We traded a life of constant novelty (and danger) as nomadic hunter-gatherers for banality, long work hours, and poor nutrition as fledgling farmers. If the transition to agriculture was so detrimental on an individual level, than why did humanity nearly unanimously decide to adopt this system? The answer is simple: humans traded individual life satisfaction for the well-being of the entire species. Individuals in villages had less enjoyable lifestyles, but they were able to support and raise more children because of the guarantee of at least a survival amount of sustenance. Consequently, the population of agricultural societies boomed and farming tribes were able to dominate nomadic bands through sheer numbers. Agricultural, for better or worse, became the default option for humans and allowed for the beginning of the exponential growth in population that has not slowed to this day. The ability to trade individual happiness for the good of the species was enabled by the creation of what Harari has labeled inter-subjective realities. The two conventional forms of human experience are subjective: concepts that cannot be touched such as emotions and ideas, and objective: physical realities like the objects and environment around us. Inter-subjective realities occupy a middle-space: they are creations that exist only in the human mind but enable collective action because a vast number of people believe in them. When we look at our modern world, we see we are surrounded by inter-subjective realities: religion, money, government, nations, and corporations are all shared myths. There are no gods except in the minds of humans and once enough people stop believing in a particular god, she/he will cease to exist, as evidenced by the thousands of religions throughout human history that are no longer practiced. Money is perhaps the best example of an inter-subjective reality. We don\\u2019t generally stop to think about it, but the pieces of green paper we spend so much of our waking time trying to acquire have no inherent value. They by themselves cannot satisfy our hunger, increase our happiness, or cure illness. However, they can be traded to achieve those ends because everyone in our society believes that money should have value. If all humans were to collectively stop thinking that money had any value tomorrow, then that would be the new reality. Moreover, we can exchange money for goods and services without any pieces of paper changing hands. As an illustration, consider that $60 trillion worth of transactions are conducted around the world on a yearly basis yet only $6 trillion of actual money exists. The entire system depends on the large-scale belief that the changing of numbers on a screen can represent a change in ownership of a physical object. The idea of shared myths that enable collective action is the most important in the book. When viewing the world in this context, we can see how nearly all of our institutions are founded on one inter-subjective reality or another. Laws only have force because enough people believe in them to allow us to create police forces that enforce the rules. Government is not a fundamental constant of the universe, but rather a system where we willing subject ourselves to the control of a larger entity because we have convinced ourselves that is the proper thing to do. The critical aspect of inter-subjective realities is even though the concepts themselves have no concrete existence, they inspire action that results in the transformation of the world around us. Humans are incapable of maintaining a social circle larger than 125\\u2013150 individuals through direct communication (known as Dunbar\\u2019s number). Any group smaller than this can be compelled to action through personal relationships between members of the group. However, as human societies expanded past this number at the beginning of the agricultural revolution, inter-subjective realities came to take the place of relationships as a motivating factor for action. Two citizens in a village of 10,000 may be complete strangers, but they are willing to work together if they share the same god, just as two individuals in a large corporation today can collaborate even without a personal relationship because they believe in the purpose of the corporation. As living conditions for individual humans decreased with the adoption of farming, humanity as a whole successfully expanded and citizens were compelled to work together because they shared the same myths and stories. When we must work with a stranger, we find it easier if they share the same belief systems, such as a political alliance or nationality. Even though we may have no personal experiences together, we share a common set of myths and values that unite us and allow for productive collaboration. The Scientific Revolution and Our New Guiding Myths Beginning 450 years ago, the shared myths of humanity underwent a transformation. We slowly began to discard religious dogmas and an unquestioning acceptance of the order of the world in exchange for secular beliefs and inquiry. While there had been individuals who investigated the natural world and made some progress in explaining how things work in antiquity (the Greek Eratosthenes and the Persian Avicenna come to mind), the general consensus prior to the 1600s was that God \\u2014 or another diety \\u2014 had created the world in its present form and that there were no unanswered questions if only one looked for the answers in the word of God. It was only as individuals and gradually societies began to throw off the shackles of religious thinking and admitted that humans did in fact not know everything that progress began in fields such as biology, geology, math, and physics. The scientific revolution truly began once we started to admit our own ignorance. Much as the deeper you delve into a subject, the more you realize you don\\u2019t know about it (a phenomenon that manifests itself in the Dunning-Kruger effect), as we began to admit our ignorance in some areas, we quickly discovered that we were standing at the very edge of an unimaginably vast continent of knowledge. The embrace of our ignorance was the dawn of the remarkable era characterized by incredible gains in our knowledge of the world. However, as Harari reminds us throughout the book, science does not just happen for the sake of knowledge. There always must be something used to justify scientific inquiry, and for the majority of the past 400 years, those forces have been imperialism and capitalism. Today we remember the great exploration fleets for their discoveries of new lands (that in reality had been inhabited for thousands of years) but the real purpose was for empires such as France, Spain, and Britain to expand their reach. Even the voyage of the HMS Beagle, the famous expedition on which Darwin conducted his research that decades later would lead to the theory of evolution by natural selection, was a surveying expedition with the intention of mapping out new territories for military advantage and expansion. The point is not to discount the knowledge gained through these expeditions, but it is to admit there was always an ulterior motive behind the discoveries. Today, science is mostly conducted under the guiding hand of capitalism. In the end, someone must pay the bills for any research, and the decision for which projects to fund often comes down to an economic potential. Again, this in no way disparages science, but we must remember that science never occurs in a vacuum and there are always interested parties behind any finding that should encourage a healthy amount of skepticism. As in agricultural times, our society still stands on shared myths. Moreover, although in our secular society we like to think of them as much more advanced than traditional belief systems, in the end, these collective beliefs, namely humanism, liberalism, and democracy, are nothing more than modern-day instantiations of religions. Humanism, or the concept that every individual has inherent worth and dignity has become the dominant world view in developed countries. In contrast to conventional belief systems, humanism holds that individuals should derive their own ethics and values internally rather than depending on an external definition delivered by a higher being. Furthermore, humanism emphasizes the importance of rationality and evidence-based decision making. In order to live as humanists, we need to respect the differences of every individual and work to ensure the average standard of living of every human increases regardless of what tribe they are from. Humanism is best viewed as a universal religion with the only sacred object being the human or humanity as a collective. Classical Liberalism, which is distinct from the modern day political idea of liberalism in the United States, embraces the autonomy of all individuals and posits that the greatest right any human has is that of self-determination, or the ability to choose one\\u2019s path. Liberalism and humanism go hand in hand as both belief in the worth of individuals and the idea that equality should be held up as a goal for any human society. These two worldviews originated in the thinking of many 17th century philosophers such as Sir Thomas More and Francis Bacon, and, in combination with Democracy, or the idea that people should be able to determine their own government (democracy is from the Greek meaning \\u201crule of the people\\u201d), they form the basis of our modern institutions. The takeaway from this section is not that humans today are vastly different and superior to our ancestors, but that we share the exact same tendencies which manifested themselves under different names. We need shared beliefs in order for our society to function, so we should not advocate moving away from them, but it is helpful to take a step back and realize that much of what we take for granted and think of as unchangeable rests on a foundation not of concrete but of mythical constructions of our imaginations. What Comes Next Harari is definitely more interested in the present/future of humanity than on the past. This can be observed in the rapidity with which he zooms over tens of thousands of years of humanity (although granted there are not that many records to draw upon from this era) in order to arrive at the present day and then delve boldly into the future. As a long-term optimist more concerned with the future than the past, I found the more modern coverage of the book fascinating. We are entering uncharted waters as the pace of social norms change not on the millennia-scale of biological evolution, but on the yearly or even monthly pace of technological advancement. Several possible outcomes for the future are presented here which are explored in depth in the sequel to Sapeins, Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow (review coming soon\\u2026). At the risk of putting words in his mouth, Harari seems to be cautiously optimism about the long-term prospects of humanity. As he points out, we have made remarkable progress in the latter half of the 21st century in reducing the rates of war, famine, and plague to historical lows, and we are now turning to even more ambitious projects such as the pursuit of machine superintelligence and vastly expanded human lifespans. Yet, we still have not answered some basic questions about ourselves. Even as we have gotten much wealthier, healthier, and live for substantially longer, the subjective happiness of humans has not increased. Although survey data does not go back much further than 100 years, people have reported about the same level of life satisfaction for over the decades. Moreover, people in wealthier countries are not generally any happier than those in developing parts of the world. How should we view the collective progress of humans over the past two million years if all the advances have not made us one iota happier? Harari suggests that we need to spend our research efforts in the coming decades not so much on physical well-being, but on understanding the much more complex world of emotions and mental states. The reason we are not content even with objectively less suffering in our lives is that happiness = reality-expectations. When reality exceeds our expectations, we experience joy, and when our expectations were much greater than our actual experience, we are disappointed. The issue is that every time we improve our material standing, we raise our expectations which means that reality must also get better in order for us to experience emotional gains. Likewise, we view ourselves in the context of our neighbors and people in our socioeconomic class as opposed to past humans or even those in other countries living in much different circumstances. The happiness equation implies that we even though we will always be driven to improve our well-being, any improvement will not really make us satisfied. We are on a quixotic quest for the objects that we think will make us happier as we increasingly push to the side those parts of our lives \\u2014 personal relationships, time spent with family, quiet times sitting and staring at the scenery \\u2014 that actually have been shown to bring us lasting joy. Harari ends the book by saying that the question we need to ask moving forward is not \\u201cWhat do we want?\\u201d, but \\u201cWhat do we want to want?\\u201d While cryptic, the message is that in the 21st century, we should concentrate on defining what makes us happy and how we can construct a society that leads to the greatest increase in happiness rather than continuing to increase wealth. Instead of judging the success of a country on its Gross National Product (the total value of all the goods and services produced by the citizens of a country) we should compare countries based on Average Citizen Happiness. I agree with Harari that the next frontier in medicine might not be physical, but mental and emotional. We have figured out the keys to a long life, but now we need to concentrate on the factors for a enjoyable life. Where I disagree with Harari is in his dire prediction for the future of humans as machine intelligence becomes superior to humans in any number of tasks. The main argument is that humans will be rendered economically useless by more capable machines in the near future. In prior technological revolutions, when we lost our physical advantage over machines, we switched to industries in which we maintained an intellectual advantage, but already algorithms that are more skilled than humans at numerous cognitive tasks are being implemented in many situations. While the concept of technological evolution leading to human irrelevance seems to be prevalent among some of the leading technology figures of our day, I am more optimistic about the ability of humans to adapt to changing situations. Sapiens demonstrates that it was human ingenuity, enabled by a unique set of biological and cognitive advances, that allowed us to shape the world to our will and this ability to solve complex problems through cooperation has us well prepared for the next set of challenges. Recommendation There are so many critical ideas in this book \\u2014 inter-subjective realities, ignorance begets knowledge, communication as a radical innovation, how to define happiness \\u2014 that reading any review or summary can never capture a majority of them. I recommend reading the entire book and then sitting quietly for a whole week to let it sink it. I finished this book brimming with subjects to talk about and was quite disappointed to realize that not everyone I encountered had also read the book. Sapiens is opinionated at times, and the last section is more aptly categorized as science fiction than history, but that is part of what differentiates it from traditional mundane history accounts. Sapiens is incredibly well-researched, but any history book, no matter how thorough, is bound to have minor errors that will only be revealed through subsequent findings. The key to avoiding being wrong when talking about the past is to focus on the larger trends, those that will be unlikely to change even as the underlying details shift. The book is readable precisely because it does not spend time examining every minute detail of historical situations. This work, along with several other history books with bold ideas (Guns, Germs, and Steel and The Better Angels of Our Nature) have finally managed to overcome the four dreadful years of history I experienced in high school and made me once again curious about the past. When I want to be put to sleep, I know that I have a stack of old history textbooks that I can rely upon, but when I want something interesting to discuss at work or the dinner table, I am confident that Sapiens will provide me with conversations for years to come. Near Earth Asteroid Scout Attitude Control System Validation and Verification Author\\u2019s Note: The following is a report of my work I completed while an intern at the NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) in Huntsville, Alabama. This project was conducted in Winter/Spring 2017 with the Near Earth Asteroid Scout Control, Navigation, and Mission Analysis Team. [Numbers in brackets are citations that refer to references listed at the end] Abstract Near Earth Asteroid (NEA) Scout is a 6-unit Cubesat which will sail to an asteroid within one Astronomical Unit (AU) of Earth. Upon rendezvous with asteroid 1991 VG, NEA Scout will perform optical scientific observations in preparation for an eventual crewed expedition to an asteroid. NEA Scout is a solar sailing satellite, a unique class of spacecraft propelled primarily by the reflection of photons from an eighty-six square meter composite sail. In addition to optical data gathering and characterization of an asteroid, NEA Scout will demonstrate the feasibility of solar sailing technology for interplanetary missions. The Attitude Control System (ACS) for NEA Scout is composed of three primary actuators: Reaction Wheels (RW), the Reaction Control System (RCS), and an Active Mass Translator (AMT). The Guidance and Control (G&C) software which manages the ACS is developed in MATLAB and modeled using Simulink Block Diagrams and will be autocoded into C before being uploaded to the spacecraft. Before the code development can be completed, it must undergo extensive verification, to ensure that it satisfies all expected requirements, and validation, to assess if it fulfills the intended purpose. Validation and Verification (V&V) of the NEA Scout ACS consists of numerous smaller tasks that form part of the larger ongoing development effort. For each V&V step, scripts must be written, data must be gathered and analyzed, and changes need to be implemented based upon the results. Hardware sensors, including sun sensors, must also be tested both for accuracy and to ensure smooth integration with the complete ACS software. Validation and Verification is crucial to the development of a robust ACS in advance of final preparation of NEA Scout for launch on the Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Mission 1 (EM-1) planned for 2018. I. Introduction The concept of sailing through the solar system propelled only by the momentum of the sun\\u2019s photons is not a new one. As early as the 1920s, the father of astronautics, Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, described using \\u201ctremendous mirrors of very thin sheets\\u201d to attain \\u201ccosmic velocities.\\u201d [1] The idea of propellantless space travel using solar sails has been an attractive method to overcome the limitations of a finite reaction mass and enable a wide range of missions throughout the solar system. As shown by James Clerk Maxwell in 1873, photons, though massless, have momentum and therefore exert pressure on a surface. Solar sails take advantage of the miniscule pressure of solar radiation by using massive, extremely thin and light sails that maximize the number of photons reflected. An ideal solar sail would be flat and completely specularly reflective as a photon that is reflected straight back from a surface will impart twice its initial momentum to the surface. This momentum is transferred to the spacecraft, and, over a large enough sail, and a long enough time period, substantial accelerations can be attained. Moreover, by controlling the angle of the sail normal relative to the sun (the Sun Incidence Angle or SIA), the sail attitude or direction is altered and the sail will gain or lose orbital momentum. This allows the solar sail to tack, sailing towards the sun, or turn outwards towards the outer reaches of the solar system[1]. Although solar sailing missions were investigated extensively by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in the 1970s as an opportunity to rendezvous with Halley\\u2019s Comet, it has not been until the past decade that solar sails have seen flight missions. The Interplanetary Kite-Craft Accelerated by Radiation of the Sun (IKAROS) launched by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in 2010[2] was the first solar sailing craft to make it into space followed by NanoSail-D launched by NASA in late 2010 [3]. In 2015, the Planetary Society launched Light-Sail 1 [4], and Light-Sail 2 is planned for liftoff on a Falcon Heavy in 2017. Near Earth Asteroid Scout (NEAS) is the latest iteration from NASA in this unique category of spacecraft. NEA Scout\\u2019s main objective is to sail to an asteroid within 1 Astronomical Unit (AU) from Earth and perform a close (<10 km) flyby [5]. NEA Scout is a 6-unit Cubesat and is approximately 30x20x10 cm in size. It weighs slightly over 11 kg and is designed based on the common Cubesat philosophy of utilizing Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) parts. When the solar sail is completely unfurled (see left side of Fig. 1), it will be 86 m\\u00b2 although it is only 2.5 micrometers (\\u00b5m) thick. The sail itself is composed of CP1 polymer with a 10 nanometer (nm) coating of aluminum on the front side (facing towards the sun) and an uncoated back side [6]. NEA Scout is viewed by NASA as a precursor to a potential crewed mission to an asteroid as well as a demonstration of the feasibility of using solar sails for interplanetary missions. The current target for NEA Scout is 1991 VG, although that is subject to change depending on the launch schedule. NEA Scout is expected to reach the asteroid after a 2\\u20132.5 year journey and will fly by at a relative speed of 10\\u201320 m/s. NEA Scout will fly on the first launch of NASA\\u2019s Space Launch System (SLS) Exploration Mission One (EM-1), and is one of thirteen secondary cubesat missions that will be launched from the Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle Stage Adapter (MCA) [5]. The Attitude Control System (ACS) on NEA Scout is responsible for maintaining the correct heading (direction) of the spacecraft and is shown on the right side of Fig. 1. It is composed of three actuating systems: an Active Mass Translator (AMT), a Reaction Control System (RCS), and Reaction Wheels (RW). Each system has its own set of requirements and responsibilities. The RCS utilizes 6 cold gas thrusters and is tasked with managing the roll (z-axis) momentum of the RW, performing the detumble upon deployment from the SLS MSA, accomplishing the trajectory correction maneuver to put the spacecraft on the right initial path, and recovering from any unforeseen situations. The AMT manages the pitch and yaw (x-axis and y-axis) momentum of the RW by shifting the center of mass of the spacecraft relative to the center of pressure which alters the magnitude and direction of the moment produced by the solar force. The RW allow fine directional pointing for science, communication, and trajectory guidance. They change the attitude of the spacecraft by exerting a torque as they speed up. However, the RW have a maximum rate of 5000 rotations per minute (RPM)5000 which means that in certain situations they will need to be slowed down, or desaturated, by the RCS. The ACS also has a suite of sensors used to determine the state of the spacecraft. Three coarse sun sensors are used on detumble for sun pointing before the solar panels can be deployed to charge the batteries. After the initial phase of the mission, the start tracker will be used for accurate attitude data at low body rates. The star tracker is the primary sensor in terms of providing attitude and body rates for the mission after the sail has been deployed. Finally, an inertial measurement unit (IMU) provides body rate information during detumble and when relatively high body rates are expected. The IMU demonstrates more accurate performance than the star tracker at high body rates, but the rates are much noisier and require extensive filtering. Therefore, at lower body rates, the star tracker is the preferred sensor for determining the state of the spacecraft. The unique characteristics of solar sails, including high solar disturbance torques, low frequency flexible body effects, and a large moment of inertia with the sail deployed, make attitude control a challenge. [6] Therefore, extensive Validation and Verification (V&V) of the ACS is required in order to ensure that the system meets all requirements, can fulfill its intended mission purpose, and is robust against unforeseen states. Initial development and testing of the ACS has demonstrated that it can carry out the entire mission concept of operations under nominal conditions. The Guidance and Control (G&C) software manages the ACS and is implemented as a series of MATLAB scripts and modeled using Simulink Block Diagrams as shown in Fig. 2. As MATLAB is a high-level interpreted language, it is too slow and unreliable to be uploaded directly to the spacecraft. Therefore, prior to being loaded onto NEA Scout, the MATLAB G&C software will be auto-coded into C. However, before development can be completed, the software must be validated to ensure that it can meet all requirements of the mission. The definition of software verification from the IEEE-STD-610 states: \\u201cthe process of evaluating software during or at the end of the development process to determine whether it satisfies specified requirements.\\u201d [7] For NEA Scout, these requirements are derived from the mission objectives which determine the parameters needed by the ACS. V&V is intended to catch any errors in the code-base and test off-nominal scenarios. Rather than a single focused project, validation and verification is composed of a number of smaller steps that test a variety of situations and compare results to expected outcomes. V&V encompasses writing MATLAB scripts to test different phases of the mission, analyzing the resulting data to determine if requirements were satisfied, reporting the data to the G&C team, and implementing any changes based upon the simulation. This report details several studies which were undertaken in order to assess various aspects of both the G&C software and the ACS functionality. The main objectives were to test different phases of the mission and situations that could be encountered by the spacecraft, to ensure that the system was robust to off-nominal conditions, and to check that there were no unnoticed errors in the software that could result in a mission failure. In addition to working with the software simulation, this report also details testing of the sun sensor engineering development unit. This testing is also a crucial aspect of validation and verification because it characterizes the sensors for calibration purposes and tests that the sensors correctly interface with the software. The objectives of the sun sensor testing is ensuring that the data from the sensors is accurate and that it is correctly interpreted by the model to inform ACS actions. Each test documented in this report is independent, but also forms part of the larger process of G&C development for NEA Scout. The work documented here is but a small part of the entire process that goes into making a spacecraft a success. NEA Scout may be a small spacecraft, but it is a complex project with many people and independent entities working to ensure that its sailing mission will be a successful one. II. Verification and Validation Analyses 1. Reaction Control System Manufacturing Variability Study The Reaction Control System (RCS) on NEA Scout has five primary responsibilities corresponding to different phases of the mission. These duties are composed of initial spacecraft detumble, initial sun-pointing and attitude hold, the trajectory correction maneuver (TCM), reaction wheel z-axis momentum desaturation, and safe mode operation. [6] The RCS uses six cold gas thrusters for actuation with Refrigerant-236fa as the propellant. Two of the thrusters are situated axially and are only used during the TCM where they are fired continuously to provide the necessary delta-v to set NEA Scout on its course. The four non-axial thrusters will be used for attitude control and reaction wheel momentum desaturation during the remainder of the mission. The layout of the RCS is shown in Fig. 3. The critical responsibility of the RCS is the initial detumble of the spacecraft upon ejection from the Space Launch System Stage Adapter. All of the secondary payloads on SLS EM-1 will be launched, resulting in uncertain deployment conditions. It is expected that NEA Scout will be tumbling upon ejection with a maximum body rate of 10 degrees per second on each axis. The RCS must be able to null these angular rates to stabilize the spacecraft and perform initial sun pointing in order for the solar panels to be deployed to charge the batteries. The spacecraft carries only 1.25kg of propellant for the entire mission, and subsequently, the amount of propellant consumed during the detumble is a parameter of significance. Vacco, the manufacturer of the RCS cold-gas thrusters, can meet the design thrust magnitude requirements for each thruster within \\u00b110%. This equates to 25 mN \\u00b1 2.5 mN (milliNewtons) of thrust for each thruster. Likewise, the angle (direction) of each nozzle is accurate to within \\u00b1 0.5\\u02da[6]. The thrusters are oriented with both a clock (azimuth) angle of 45\\u02da relative to the x-axis, and an elevation angle relative to the xy-plane. Both of these angles on each thruster are subject to the same variability. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of this manufacturing variability on the fuel consumed and the time to detumble. The baseline fuel use for the detumble maneuver with the specified exact thrust magnitude and direction and starting with a 10 degrees/second rate on all three body axes was 1.389 grams. Similarly, the baseline time to detumble was 41.6 seconds. The time to detumble was calculated based on the time taken to null the body rates to less than 0.1 degrees/ second on each axis. The manufacturing variations in magnitude and direction were studied separately, with the objective of characterizing the worst case in each category. For the magnitude deviation, there were four anomalous cases identified which are summarized in Table 1. The performance characteristics of the case are summarized in the left half of the table while the right side shows the exact configuration of variability in each of the four non-axial jets. The fourteenth run had a fuel usage more than twice that of the baseline and was the most extreme case in terms of fuel usage. Although this is a large amount relative to the baseline nominal case, it was determined to be of no significant concern for the overall mission as the amount of fuel consumed was less than 0.25% of the total fuel available. Interestingly, several of the cases turned out have better performance than the baseline both in terms of fuel use and time to detumble. Fig. 4 and 5 show the plots of time to detumble and the fuel usage for the four anomalous cases identified from the thrust magnitude variation study and summarized in Table 1. The next step was to perform the same analysis but instead of varying the magnitude of the thrust, alter the direction of the four off-axial jets to model the variation specified by the manufacturer. Each of the jets had an uncertainty of 0.5\\u02da on both the elevation and azimuth angle. As before, the four most extreme cases were identified for further inspection. These cases are summarized in Table 2. The worst case in the direction variation configuration used almost three times the fuel use of the baseline case, but again, the total fuel used was judged to be inconsequential for the overall mission especially as the detumble is a one-time event. The conclusion from the thrust magnitude and direction manufacturing variation study is that the manufacturing tolerances will allow for a satisfactory detumble even under the worst case scenario deployment of 10 degrees/second on each body axis. Although the fuel usage could be up to three times greater than the baseline depending on the exact configuration of the variation, this was determined by the G&C team to be within acceptable levels for the one-time detumble maneuver. The total fuel usage for even the worst case was under 0.5% of the fuel budget for the mission. Even with a worst case manufacturing variation, the effects for the entire mission would be minimal and all objectives could still be accomplished. Further work in the area of hardware variability could include accounting for both the angle variation and the thrust variation of the thrusters in the same run. Based on the preliminary work, this was deemed unnecessary because none of the initial cases were severe enough to impact the mission. However, the hardware variation for the RCS and other systems could potentially impact other areas of the mission concept of operations and should be investigated in order to implement any corrections that could mitigate or overcome decreased performance. 2. Modeling Effects of Specular Reflectivity on Thrust Light incident upon a surface, can be either reflected, absorbed, or transmitted. The light that is reflected can be further categorized as being either specularly reflected or diffusely reflected. Specular reflection refers to when the reflected light ray has the same angle relative to the surface normal as the incident light. Diffuse (Lambertian) reflection on the other hand, is when the reflected light rays is scattered and leaves the surface at an angle different from that of the incident ray [8]. These two definitions are summarized in Fig. 6. The symbol s is called the specular reflectivity coefficient and represents the fraction of reflected light that is specular. It is a crucial material property that greatly influences both the magnitude and direction of thrust that a solar sail is able to extract from solar radiation pressure. As the specular reflectivity coefficient decreases, the diffuse reflection increases and the solar sail will experience a greater force in the plane of the sail, resulting in a larger torque [1]. The torque resulting from the force of the sun\\u2019s photons is called a solar torque. This solar torque must be managed by the attitude control system in order for the spacecraft to remain oriented correctly. The solar torque generated on the x-axis and y-axis is handled by the Active Mass Translator (AMT). This actuator shifts the spacecraft center of mass relative to the center of pressure and is therefore able to trim the torques from the order of micro-Newton-meters (mNm) to tens of nano-Nm. The torque about the z-axis is known as the roll or \\u201cwindmill\\u201d torque and must be controlled by the RCS using a minimal, but non-zero amount of fuel. Consequently, it is of great interest to the guidance and control group to characterize the solar torque as a function of the specular reflectivity coefficient. Although this value is a material property, for a given material it can change depending on the extent of deformation of the material. For a solar sail, this deformation occurs in the form of wrinkles. There are three categories of wrinkles that occur in a solar sail the size of NEA Scout; macro-, meso-, and microscale. Wrinkles on the order of a meter to centimeters (1 \\u20130.01 meters) are labeled macro scale and can be effectively modeled in structural finite element models (FEM) such as that created for the NEA Scout G&C software model. Wrinkles on the microscale, or those smaller than 10s of micrometers (10\\u20136 meters), can be considered a material roughness and thus the effects on the sail optical characteristics are captured by the Bidirectional Reflectance (BDRF) test. However, wrinkles in the middle size category, considered meso-scale (millimeters to tens of micrometers, 10\\u20133\\u201310\\u20135 meters), cannot be accurately modeled using either material characteristics or an FEM. As shown by Heaton et al. [8] these wrinkles must be taken into account through the alteration of the specular reflectivity coefficient as the wrinkles effectively increase the diffuse reflection of the solar sail material. The first characterization of the specular reflectivity coefficient was completed at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory as part of the preparation for the proposed Halley\\u2019s Comet mission. These tests were conducted on pristine samples and later research performed in 2015 lowered the specular coefficient from 0.94 \\u00b1 0.04 to 0.89 \\u00b1 0.045. [8] However, more recent testing on larger 10 cm\\u00b2 samples of the sail material used for NEA Scout has shown that the specular reflectivity coefficient for a full-scale solar sail upon deployment will be even lower. [8] Furthermore, the coefficient can vary widely across the sail because the meso-scale wrinkle distribution is highly non-uniform even when unfurling the sail in a controlled test environment. Testing performed at MSFC observed values for the specular reflectivity coefficient that ranged from 0.804 to 0.300 across samples from the sail. This is a significant cause for concern as this value determines the magnitude and direction of the solar force experienced by the sail which in turn affects spacecraft performance, from the characteristic acceleration to the solar torques. The default value for the specular reflectivity coefficient in use in the development of the MATLAB and Simulink model was 0.89. The purpose of this study was to characterize and describe the effects of changing the value to a more realistic value provided by recent full-scale sail tests. The ideal optical model of the force on a solar sail comes from the Jet Propulsion Laboratory and was published in McInnes [1] and Wright [9]. The equations governing the tangential and normal force are described as follows: where the terms in Eq. (1) and (2) are defined in the nomenclature. Eq. 1 describes the force tangential to the plane of the sail and Eq. 2 describes the force normal to the plane. The specular reflectivity coefficient is given as s and is a crucial variable in both equations. As s decreases, the sail experiences a greater force tangential to the plane of the sail and therefore receives greater solar torques. After some deliberation, it was decided that the majority of cases for the investigation should be run with a coefficient of 0.563 and 0.444. The cases would be run with a single value of s across the entire sail and these were judged to be the lowest realistic effective average values for the entire sail of NEA Scout. The modeling study on the ramifications of altering the specular reflectivity coefficient had two phases: first, an optimized standalone thrust model developed [8] for the G&C simulations was used to characterize the levels of force and torque experienced by the sail for a selection of specular reflectivity coefficients across a range of sun incidence angles (SIA). Once the effects had been described in an ideal model, the specular reflectivity coefficient changes would be implemented across the entire MATLAB model in order to see if the attitude control system would be able to handle the resulting solar forces and torques (torque is used interchangeably with moment). The results of running the sail model in the stand-alone thrust model are shown in Fig. 7 and 8. Changes in the specular coefficient do not significantly impact the magnitude of the force but the magnitude of the solar torque is substantially altered. Here, the magnitude of the force is defined as the norm of the tangential and normal forces and the magnitude of the moment is defined as the norm of the x, y, and z moments. The worst case from the first phase of the study corresponds to the lowest specular coefficient as expected and is characterized by the greatest solar torques across the range of SIA. After completing the preliminary studies in the stand-alone thrust model, the variation in specular reflectivity was implemented in the full simulation. The script used to test the effects of the variation in thrust and moment was a simple attitude hold script that attempted to maintain the same attitude of the sail over the entire length of the simulation. In the full simulation, the roll angle (clock angle) of the sail was set at 0\\u02da and the sun incidence angle was increased until the attitude control system could no longer manage the solar torque. Fig. 9 shows the main scope from a simulation run with a specular reflectivity coefficient of 0.563 and a sun incidence angle of 55\\u02da. As can be seen in the lower right plot, the Active Mass Translator (AMT) does not run into its limits which are at 3.5 cm on the y-axis and 8 cm on the x-axis. The x-axis and y-axis momentum of the RW can be successfully managed under these conditions by the AMT and will not require the RCS jets to fire to desaturate the wheels. In order to quantify the effects of changing the value, the maximum SIA for which the AMT could manage the x-axis and y-axis momentum was determined for both the case with s = 0.563 and s = 0.444. With a coefficient of 0.444, the maximum SIA was 45\\u02da while at a coefficient of 0.563, the maximum SIA that could be tolerated was 55\\u02da. The maximum nominal SIA for the mission is 50\\u02da, and therefore, even with the worst feasible specular coefficient, the AMT should is able to handle the resulting solar torques across nearly the entire range of SIA. When the AMT cannot handle the momentum of the wheels, the RCS is forced to fire to desaturate the wheels and manage the x-axis and y-axis momentum in addition to its nominal duty of managing the z-axis momentum. The conclusion that was drawn was that even accounting for a significant decrease in the specular reflectivity coefficient, the RW x-axis and y-axis momentum should be adequately managed by the AMT for nearly all expected operating angles of the spacecraft. Further work in this direction should include an attempt to characterize the optical properties of the entire sail. Due to the size and the delicacy of the sail, testing the entire sail on Earth has not been feasible. Currently, testing [8] has been carried out on 10 cm\\u00b2 pieces of the sail, which is a significant size difference from the full sail at 86 m\\u00b2. Even with this small sample, the optical properties varied widely across the sample because of the distribution of wrinkles. It is clear from this current study that the optical properties of the sail can have a large effect on the performance of the mission. Although this study did not identify any significant reasons for concern for the NEA Scout mission, this is an area that has been difficult to accurately characterize and more research is needed in preparation for future solar sailing missions. Ideally, optical data can be gathered from NEA Scout when it is deployed on orbit that will help advance the state of specular reflectivity knowledge. The greatest limitation currently confronted by solar sails is the lack of flight experience, and any flight data gathered by NEA Scout will prove invaluable to the nascent province of solar sailing. 3. Passive Roll Control Although NEA Scout utilizes the propellantless method of solar sailing for primary propulsion, like all other spacecraft, it is still operationally limited by the amount of propellant it can carry because of mission critical functions that still must be carried out by the RCS. Therefore, any potential method for reduction of fuel use is attractive to the mission. One such area that holds promise for reducing or even eliminating fuel consumption is that of passive rol control. The current concept of operations specifies that the x-axis and y-axis momentum of the reaction wheels is managed through the use of the AMT and the z-axis (roll) momentum is managed by the RCS. The RCS will also be commanded to fire if the speed of the wheels crosses a pre-determined threshold as may occur when the AMT alone cannot manage the solar torque. A worse case estimate [6] of fuel consumption used by the RCS to manage the roll momentum for the entire mission is 240 grams (out of 1.25 kg total for the mission). Even though this fuel use is accounted for in the nominal mission plan and will not affect the primary objectives, any reduction in this value will add margin for unplanned circumstances and could open up the possibility of extending the mission to visit another celestial body. Consequently, one area of research for NEA Scout is propellantless z-axis (roll) momentum management. The roll torque experienced by the spacecraft is a function of both the roll and SIA. At SIA larger than 20\\u02da, there is a zero crossing in the roll torque at certain roll angles as illustrated in Fig. 10. For a given SIA above 20\\u02da, there is at least one roll angle at which the solar z-torque is zero. If the solar sail can achieve this angle at a low enough roll rate, the sail should \\u201ccatch\\u201d at the angle, that is, the sail would oscillate about that roll angle rather than continue to roll around the z-axis and build up momentum. These equilibrium points occur where the slope of the torque vs roll angle plot is negative and where the roll torque crosses zero. This occurs at clock angles of near 0\\u02da and near 180\\u02da as demonstrated in Fig. 10. At these stable points, the sail will oscillate about equilibrium and over a long enough time frame, the magnitude of the oscillations would decay due to structural damping. This process could also be sped up with an additional energy sink. [6] The objective of this study was to determine the initial roll angles (used interchangeably with clock angles) that allow the sail to reach a stable oscillation point for a given SIA. The designated approach was to first explore the problem in a stand-alone passive roll control model, and then move on to modeling the situation in the full simulation. Table 3 shows a summary of results for a subset of the different angle combinations which were run. The preliminary work demonstrated that depending on the SIA and the starting roll angle, the sail could reach a stable point without the use of the RCS. Fig. 11 demonstrates the attainment of a stable oscillation angle. The top plot in Fig. 11 shows that the sail oscillates about a roll (clock) angle of 20\\u02da indefinitely. In the unstable cases by contrast, the roll angle continues to grow over time without bound and the spacecraft spins about the z-axis until the RCS must fire to control the RW momentum. After categorizing the cases into stable and unstable, several trials were then run in the entire simulation, in order to verify the results and look for unexpected results that may not have manifested in a simplified model. A further investigation was conducted to determine if the unstable cases could be stabilized using the RCS. The problem in the unstable cases is that the sail begins at an initial roll angle where it is subjected to significant z-axis torques. Therefore, when the sail reach the zero crossing in the roll torque graph, the sail already has too much momentum to be \\u201ccaught\\u201d at a stable point and continues spinning and gaining momentum. To resolve this issue, the hypothesis is that the RCS could fire for a minimal amount of time and coerce the solar sail into a specified roll angle about which the sail would be stable. To test this hypothesis, an unstable case was run with the RCS activating above a body rate threshold of 3 x 10\\u20133 deg/sec on any of the body axes. The initial conditions were SIA = 30\\u02da and initial clock angle = 100\\u02da which had been verified as an unstable case in the full-scale simulation. The results of this examination are illustrated by the main summary in Fig. 12. Of primary interest in Fig. 12 is the plot in the upper right corner showing body rate vs time (the y-axis scale is in 10^-3 Nm and the x-axis scale is in 10\\u2075 seconds). The sail spins about all three axis with an initially increasing body rate on the z-axis as indicated by the red line. After the body rate crosses the threshold for RCS activation, the RCS fires and nulls the body rate on this axis at around 0.7 x 10\\u2075 seconds. After this point, the sail is caught around a stable point and the body rates on all three axes remain below the threshold. This indicates that rather than continuing to spin about the z-axis, the sail has is oscillating about a stable point. Moreover, for the rest of the simulation, the RW speeds remain well below the 5000 rpm saturation limit and the AMT does not come close to reaching its limits. Overall, the test demonstrated that a stable point could be reached from an initially unstable configuration using the RCS. While the RCS would consume propellant to initially induce the sail into this stable point, the overall fuel usage for this situation would be less than having the RCS continually fire to desaturate the z-momentum of the RW. In conclusion, this study proved that at least in the full-scale model of NEA Scout, passive roll control is a feasible option for managing the z-axis momentum. If a stable point can be reached either with or without the assistance of the RCS, the sail will oscillate about one clock angle and the RCS will not be needed to desaturate the reaction wheels resulting in lower fuel usage and increasing the mission possibilities. 4. Reflectivity Control Device (RCD) A promising proposed technology for propellantless attitude control is that of reflective control devices (RCD). The amount of force imparted on a surface by solar radiation pressure is proportional to the reflectivity of the surface as shown in Eq. 1 and 2. The concept of an RCD is that by altering the reflectivity of small areas of a solar sail, the force exerted on that region would be changed and a torque could be generated that could be used to orient the spacecraft as required. A region of the sail that is more reflective will generate a larger force that an equal sized area that is less reflective all other factors being equal. [1] The method examined in this study calls for each RCD to be composed of two regions, which are placed on opposite ends of one of the sail booms (support beams for the sail). The proposed design further specifies two RCDs on the sail which results in a total of four areas, one on each of the tips of the booms. By altering the reflectivity of one area in each pair, there will be a difference in forces exerted on the two areas making up the RCD. The torque is then this difference in force times the moment arm of the areas to the x-axis or y-axis. A schematic is presented in Fig. 13 although this design specifies eight RCDs, with four situated vertically and four situated horizontally. [10] The method of altering reflectivity for attitude control was successfully demonstrated by the Japanese Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) IKAROS solar sailing spacecraft launched in 2010 [2]. This was the world\\u2019s first validation of interplanetary solar sailing, and featured several novel techniques which had yet to be implemented including RCDs. On ICAROS this took the form of flexible multi-layer sheets placed around the sail that transitioned from diffuse-dominant reflectance to specular-dominant reflectance. The sheets are composed of liquid-crystals, and when a voltage was applied, the sheet became more reflective and hence has a higher specular coefficient and generates more force from the solar radiation pressure. When the voltage is removed, the sheet is rendered opaque and the reflection is dominated by diffusion lowering the force. By manipulating the cycling of these patches, the entire spacecraft attitude could be controlled [2]. A picture of IKAROS with the RCDs labeled is shown in Fig. 14 The concept under consideration for this study is the same as that of IKAROS although the implementation varies slightly with the two RCDs being placed at the four corners of the sail rather than along the edges as for the Japanese spacecraft. A further difference is that for the present study, when the voltage is off, the panels are opaque and when the devices are turned on, the RCD panels become transparent. Thus, the panels transition from diffuse reflection when off to transmission when on and generate a torque from the difference in force experienced by each panel [10]. The center of the sail remains the same CP1 polymer coated with aluminum for greatest reflection of the photons and the maximum thrust. Although it is too late in the timeline for NEA Scout to be equipped with RCDs, the current study was performed on a NEA Scout-like solar sail to gauge practicality for future missions. MSFC is currently working with researchers at the University of Maryland for the development of the films used in the RCDs. The researchers at Maryland [10] use polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) film as the altered material. These films can be easily switched from opaque to transparent and have been implement in flat panel displays and smart windows including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner windows which can be electronically dimmed. [11] Research conducted at the University of Maryland has focused on characterizing the optical properties of these PDLC films for use in RCDs. The primary figure of merit for the RCDs is the change in the fraction of incoming photon momentum absorbed when the device is switched off versus when it is switched on. The maximum fraction of momentum that can be transferred to a sail from a photon is 2.0 if the photon is specularly reflected. On ICAROS, the fraction of momentum transferred when the device was switched on was 1.51 and when the device was switched off it dropped to 1.40 as the reflection became more diffuse. The PDLC investigated at the University of Maryland has a fraction of momentum transfer of 0.43 when on and 0.93 when off for a difference of 0.50 [10]. As the difference in the fraction of momentum transferred increases, the force difference between the regions increases and therefore the torque available for controlling the sail increases in step. Work completed thus far at the University of Maryland has characterized the PDLC films based on the thickness of the film and yielded data for the energy usage, weight density, and difference in fraction of momentum transferred for several different thicknesses. In order to determine the feasibility of PDLC RCDs for a NEA Scout-size solar sail, the raw numbers provided by the researchers for the PDLC film needed to be translated into a control torque produced by a reaction control device. This could be accomplished by taking the fraction of momentum transferred provided by the researchers and calculating the control torque that would be generated as a result. The torque produced by a single RCD can be calculated using Eq. 3: where T is the torque in Nm, P is the solar radiation pressure at 1 AU (4.52E-06 N/m\\u00b2), p_diff is the difference in the fraction of momentum transferred when the device is off versus on, r is the length of the sail boom in m, A is the total area of the RCD in m\\u00b2, and \\u03b1 is the sun incidence angle of the sail in radians. This is a simplified version of the thrust equations presented in McInnes [1] and Wright [9] and is valid for a flat plate. For a preliminary estimate of the feasibility of the technology, this calculation was deemed acceptable. The results of the study are presented in Table 4. The required area was derived based upon the area needed to generate a control torque of 5 x 10^-6 Nm, considered the largest solar torque that will be encountered during the NEA Scout mission. The difference in momentum transfer declines as the thickness of the PDLC decreases which results in a larger area requirement to achieve the torque. However, the thinner PDLC films have a reduced power and weight density meaning even though they may need to be larger in size to meet the requirements, the mass and power consumption is reduced compared to thicker films. The Area Required and Mass of the RCD vs PDLC thickness is shown in Fig. 15. From the initial calculations, the power, weight, and area requirements were deemed to be on a feasible order for a NEA Scout size solar sail. If the RCD is placed flat against the plane of the sail, it will only be able to generate a change in the force that is normal to the surface of the sail which would limit the device to creating control torques about the x-axis and the y-axis. In order to generate a z-axis torque, a force must be created by the RCD tangential to the sail or in other words, in the plane of the sail. The solution derived is to place the RCD at an angle to the plane of the sail. This angle, defined as the actuator angle, is positive for a counterclockwise rotation and is the angle between the plane of the sail and the plane of the PDLC film. The next step of the study was therefore to calculate the ideal angle for the actuator that will allow for the maximum control torque about the z-axis across the widest range of SIA. Calculating the control torque from the introduction of an actuator angle is done by modifying the cosine squared term in Eq. 3 as shown in Eq. 4: where \\u03b2 is the actuator angle in radians. This equation yields the control torque about the z-axis, or the roll control torque. This equation can then be plotted for several actuator angles across a range of sun incidence angles as shown in Fig. 16. The majority of actuator angles generate a control roll torque greater than the solar disturbance torque across nearly the entire range of sun incidence angles. The maximum sun incidence angle expected under nominal mission conditions is 50\\u02da, and thus, the RCD would be an effective means for controlling the roll torque. The best candidate was selected as the 40\\u02da actuator angle because this resulted in a control roll torque greater than the solar disturbance torque across the range of anticipated sun incidence angles. Moreover, as the actuator angle is increased, the force normal to the plane generated by the RCD will decrease. An RCD with an actuator angle of 90\\u02da would generate no normal force and could not control the x-axis and y-axis torque, and 40\\u02da was a compromise between normal and tangential forces or between in-plane (x-axis and y-axis) and out-of-place (z-axis) control torque. The final step in the study was to calculate the control torque generated by a pair of RCDs. The preliminary work was carried out accounting for a single RCD with the two regions placed on opposite corners of the sail. The design specifies that an actual implementation would most likely have two pairs of RCDs placed on the four sail corners. The actuator angle used in these calculations was 40\\u02da and the RCDs magnitude of control torque was calculated for across the range of SIA and for several difference roll angles. The resulting magnitude of the control torque (the norm of the torque on all three axes) is shown in Fig. 17 along with the solar disturbance torque. The x-axis is a range of sun incidence angles while the different shaded lines represent the clock angle of the sail. Overall, the graph and associated numbers proved that the RCD set-up as specified for the current study works across the majority of sun incidence and clock angles. The magnitude of the control torque is greater than the disturbance torque across nearly all the expected sun incidence angles and at most roll angles. The conclusions of this work was that RCDs composed of PDLC films would be both practical and effective for a solar sail of NEA Scout\\u2019s size. Using the thickest PDLC film, each RCD would need to be 0.411 m\\u00b2 and would consume 1.86 Watts of power with a weight penalty of 0.0164 kg. The total power consumption would thus be slightly over 3.6 watts and the total weight would be slightly more than 30 grams accounting for only the PDLC films. To give a sense of scale, the total battery capacity on NEA Scout is 48 watt-hours. With peripherals, including wiring and the electrodes needed to apply the voltage, the total weight of the devices would be expected to be less than 100 grams compared to a total weight for NEA Scout of over 11 kg [6]. Based on this work, RCD devices would be feasible on a NEA Scout platform. The total penalty to weight and power would need to be considered, but the ability to control the attitude of the sail without expending propellant makes the reflective control device a worthwhile investment that could expand the scope of possible missions for a solar sail. Further work must be done to develop the entire RCD architecture, and testing would need to be carried out on larger samples with a potential flight demonstration as well. The Reflective Control Device technology has already been successfully proven by ICAROS, and an implementation on a future NASA solar sail mission is probable given the state of the research and the maturity of the technology. 5. Sail Recovery Modeling Among the range of off-nominal situations that NEA Scout may encounter, the most critical is that in which the solar sail flips around with the back of the sail facing directly towards the sun. There are several possible causes for this circumstance but the most likely source would be a failure of software resulting in a complete loss of the ACS. Even with the AMT in a trimmed position, the sail is not passively stable and experiences a small solar disturbance torque. Over a long enough time period, without any active control from the ACS, solar radiation pressure alone will eventually cause the sail to flip around with the back exposed to the sun. Although a complete turn-around is a severe situation, it does not necessarily have to result in a failed mission if the computer systems are able to reboot and an appropriate safe mode can be implemented. As shown in the diagram of NEA Scout in Fig. 1, the booms (support beams) for the sail are shaded from the sun by the solar sail itself. During the planning stages of NEA Scout, [5] this design choice was implemented when it was discovered that the booms would suffer severe thermal deformation if they were to be exposed to the sun. Even though the 7 meter-long booms are made of steel, they are extremely thin and can distort up to 1 m at the tips under direct sunlight in space. If the sail flips around and the backside faces towards the sun, there will be nothing to shield the booms from the thermal radiation and they will severely deform within an estimated time frame of 15\\u201330 seconds. Exact predictions of the extent of boom deformation are nearly impossible to make because of the uncertain thermal stresses that the booms will be subject to and the difficulty in modeling thermal deformation. The best estimates provided by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory specify a nominal boom deformation of 0.6 m and a maximum deformation of 1.2 m [12]. Even in the nominal case, this deformation significantly affects the performance of the sail. As the sail curvature increases from the deformation, the diffuse reflection of sunlight by the sail increases and thus the solar torque increases. The present investigation was undertaken in order to determine how long it would take the sail to flip under different situations, what conditions the sail will experience if it does flip, what would be an appropriate safe mode for recovery of the sail, and how much would the flip and recovery cost in terms of fuel and overall impact to the mission. The first step towards simulating a sail reversal was to create representations of the backside of the sail. In total, five different models were generating covering the range of possible booms deformations. The first model, labeled as the \\u201cundeformed\\u201d backside sail model, was intended to serve as a baseline with no deformation. This model, shown at the far left of Fig. 18, was made from the front side model of the sail but with the sail normals reversed in the tensor model. The other four models were simplified pyramids which attempted to account for the uncertain deformation. Four \\u201cdeformed\\u201d backside sail models were needed because both the magnitude and the direction of the deformation of the booms is unknown [12]. Two of the deformed models have the booms deforming towards the sun, and the other two have the booms deforming away from the sun with one model in each pair having a magnitude of deformation of 0.6 m and the other having the maximum 1.2 m estimated magnitude of deformation. Two of these models are shown in the center and right of Fig 18. After the sail models had been completed, the next phase of the study was to develop a script that modeled a loss of attitude control of the sail. An existing script was modified to create a \\u201cfree drift\\u201d simulation [13] in which the sail is allowed to freely rotate solely under the influence of solar radiation pressure. This script models a complete shutdown of computer systems which could have any number of causes for a spacecraft and actually occurred on LightSail 1 as a result of a file size overload [4][. (LightSail 1 systems recovered eight days later with a radiation-induced spontaneous computer reboot and the mission was able to continue successfully). The first round of trials using the free-drift script were used only to determine the behavior of the sail under no attitude control and did not include any attempts at recovery. Each model of the sail was tested starting at a SIA of 45\\u02da (a sail incidence angle greater than 90\\u02da indicates that the sail has reversed) with three different initial body rates. The results of the first phase of three runs for the non-deformed backside sail model are summarized in Table 5: The time for the sail to flip is heavily dependent on the initial starting body rate of the sail. The rate of 0.04 deg/sec on the y-axis was selected because that is the maximum body rate that is allowed during a communications slew of the spacecraft. This case modeled what would occur were the systems to shut down during a slew at the maximum rate which was considered to be the situation of most concern. Fig. 18 shows several parameters from the simulation of the non-deformed model run with an initial body rate of 0.04 deg/sec on the y axis. The bottom plot shows sun incidence angle (in degrees) versus time (in 104 seconds) and the moment when the sail reverses is identified as when the SIA goes over 90\\u02da. Furthermore, an oscillatory motion of the sail can be observed in this plot. The sail clearly flips (SIA greater than 90\\u02da) and then returns to the front side of the sail (SIA less than 90\\u02da) repeatedly. This behavior mimics that observed on NanoSail-D2, when it was flown in 2011 [3]. NanoSail-D2 could not be controlled, and began to continuously rotate from back of the sail to the front reaching body rates on the order of tens of degrees/second. The behavior demonstrated in this case is much the same although not as severe. The top plot shows the body rate (in degrees/second) for all three axes versus time. The body rate on the y-axis builds over time, and after 6 hours, has reached an alarming 0.2 deg/sec. However, this is only after around 6 hours of a complete loss of control and it is estimated that if the computer systems were to completely shut down, they could be rebooted from the ground within 15 minutes. Therefore, it is not expected that the sail would have enough time to build up substantial body rates on any axis. Based on the results from running the \\u201cfree drift\\u201d script [13], four of the worst cases were selected to be run in a recovery script that attempted to model a recovery from the loss of attitude control. The primary objective of this phase of the study was to develop and test a safe mode that could be implemented by the G&C software with a minimal impact to the mission concept of operations. The safe mode was defined by the G&C team as using the RCS jets to point the spacecraft at the sun in as short a time frame as could be achieved. The reasoning behind this decision is that it would allow the spacecraft to regain knowledge of its attitude and charge the solar panels to ensure that all systems will be adequately powered. When the spacecraft initially reboots, it will have no information about its attitude and therefore will have to rely on the sun sensors to point at the sun under the power of the RCS thrusters. Two different recovery initiation criterion were defined. The first began recovery from the maximum SIA in order to mimic a worst case scenario while the second condition began recovery after a time period of 15 minutes to model the estimated reboot time for the computer systems. The main parameters to calculate for the study were the time for the spacecraft to reach a sun-pointing attitude, and the fuel used by the RCS to achieve this condition. Table 6 summarizes the results of the recovery simulations run with the 1.2 m deformed sail model which had demonstrated the most severe behavior in the initial phase of the research. Even under the most extreme initial conditions and starting recovery from the maximum sun incidence angle, the time to recover was only 0.733 hours or 44 minutes and the fuel use was less than 12 grams. The conclusion from the second phase of the study was that the spacecraft would be able to successfully recover from a complete loss of computer systems. Moreover, the fuel and time penalty from recovery was not significant for a one-time event. This analysis further showed that a safe mode defined as sun-pointing using the RCS is practical and will be implemented into the G&C software. Another significant finding was that using IMU body rates to inform the G&C software during recovery was preferable to using star tracker rates. The star tracker is designated as the main provider of body rates and attitude knowledge during the parts of the mission where it is not expected that the body rates will be higher than 0.4 deg/sec. The IMU body rates are nominally supposed to be used only upon detumble when the star tracker will be rendered ineffective by the sun. However, in the recovery cases, using the IMU body rate information significantly reduced fuel usage because the overall body rate caused by the RCS maneuver is relatively high. At these higher rates, the IMU information can be more effectively filtered and was found to be the better choice to inform the software of the state of the spacecraft. More work on any recovery aspect of the mission should include developing a more accurate model of the backside of the sail that accounts for the boom deformation. Once that has been completed, the sail model can be tested in the free drift and recovery scripts to better characterize the behavior of the spacecraft upon flipping and the effects on the mission objectives due to this situation. 6. Sun Sensor Testing The G&C software cannot correctly manage the ACS without a proper knowledge of the spacecraft\\u2019s state including position, orientation, and rates. The NEA Scout ACS contains several different sensors which are applicable in different stages of the mission. Three coarse sun sensors are to be used primarily on deployment from SLS in order to point the spacecraft at the sun and allow the solar panels to begin charging. The sun sensors are able to provide the information necessary for the ACS to calculate the sun vector in the body frame of the spacecraft which orients the spacecraft relative to the sun [14] The sun sensors can also be used for rough rate estimates by determining the change in spacecraft orientation over time. Furthermore, the sun sensors will be used at times when the star tracker is \\u201cblinded\\u201d or has a reduced field of view whether that be from the Earth, Moon, or Sun. Thus, the sun sensors are a crucial part of the mission and must be tested both for accuracy and to ensure that the data collected by the sensors is correctly interpreted by the G&C software. NEA Scout uses three sun sensors attached to three different-facing surfaces of the spacecraft to ensure that one sensor can sense the sun at all times. One individual sun sensor is shown in Fig. 20. Each sun sensor is composed of four Silicon photodiodes that are designed to be most sensitive in the visible spectrum with wavelengths of light from 480 nm to 660 nm [14]. These four photodiodes produce an electrical signal with a strength proportional to the intensity of the light incident on the photodiode. From these four diode counts and the location of the sun sensor on the spacecraft, a sun-vector in the body frame of the spacecraft will be calculated by the G&C software. The initial task was to determine if the sun sensor could be correctly figured. The sun sensors for NEA Scout are provided by Blue Canyon Technologies (BCT) and the particular sun sensor available for testing [15] was an engineering development unit (EDU) that included the necessary communications interface to allow the sun sensor inputs to be sent to a personal computer. Configuration tests were done in the robust product demonstration test-bed in building 4600 at MSFC. The sun sensor was attached flat to a mounting bracket and subjected to electromagnetic radiation from a high intensity incandescent lamp. Several orientations of the sun sensor were tested. After each test, the resulting raw data was fed into a G&C processing script which calculates the sun vector of the spacecraft. The vectors that were output could be manually checked because the angle of the sun sensor relative to the lamp (effectively the sun incidence angle) was known and the sun sensor was modeled as being on the +z face of the spacecraft. For a sun incidence angle of 0\\u02da, the resulting unit sun vector should be [0, 0, 1] which was found to be the result. An additional task for initial testing was taking the sun sensor outside and verifying that the photodiodes were generating the correct outputs when exposed to the sun at 1 AU. From the BCT technical information, [15] the photodiodes have a minimum electrical count threshold they should register when exposed to the sun at 1 AU. After taking into account the 30% attenuation of the sun\\u2019s intensity by the Earth\\u2019s atmosphere and the seasonal decrease in solar intensity due to the 23.5\\u02da obliquity of the Earth, the photodiode counts were in the specified range. These initial configuration tests demonstrated that the engineering development unit was performing as expected and that the G&C software could convert the raw data from the sun sensors into usable information. The next step was to perform a series of tests with the sun sensor attached to a rotating telescope that could provide truth data in order to determine the accuracy of the sensor. Unfortunately, time constraints did not allow for this round of testing to be completed before the drafting of this report. However, the associated equipment for the testing was manufactured and the test description that follows will executed before the full avionics testbed. Testing is to be carried out at the Automated Lunar and Meteor Observatory (ALaMO) located on the Redstone Arsenal. This facility has a 14 inch telescope atop a 15 meter tall tower with a roll-off roof. This telescope is ideal as it features automated sun tracking and can be operated across the range of testing rates and right ascension and declination angles. Five different tests were developed to test the accuracy and capabilities of the sun sensor as summarized in Table 7. For each case, the raw diode measurements will be collected as well as the inertial right ascension and declination angles from the telescope that will serve as truth data. All measurements are to be taken at 5 samples/second and the sun sensor information is read and written to .csv files by a Python script specifically developed for the tests. With set-up time and potential delays between trials, the entire procedure duration is estimated to be four hours and will require a clear sky for the duration of the experiment. The Blue Canyon Sun Sensor Engineering Development Unit [16] electronics set is shown in Fig. 21: The sun sensor itself is mounted on a 3-D printed plate specifically designed for this test and modeled using Computer Aided Design. The grey box on the right of Fig. 21 is the XACT attitude control system box. It interfaces with the red box designated the XTC communications tool that is used to communicate between the sensor and a computer [16]. The red box is connected to a power supply and via a USB cable to a computer. The information from the sun sensor is sent to the XACT ACS using the RS-422 communication protocol. The XTC adapts this signal into a USB signal that can be used to record and save data for later analysis. The results from the initial sun sensor testing demonstrate that the sun sensor is correctly configured for the NEA Scout mission, and that the G&C software can correctly read and interpret the inputs to generate the sun vector used to orient the spacecraft. Although the final phase of sun sensor testing has yet to be completed, it will provide an accuracy check for the sun sensor and is scheduled to be completed before the full avionics testbed. Based on this study, the G&C software will be able to rely on the information provided by the sun sensor in order to issue commands to the Attitude Control System. III. Conclusions Validation and Verification of any complex system is composed of many subtasks rather than one main assignment. Each individual survey has its own takeaways and implementations that combine together to result in a robust spacecraft that is prepared to meet all mission objectives. The conclusions from each investigation detailed in this report are summarized as follows: 1. The RCS has a quantified level of manufacturing variability in both the angle and magnitude of the thrust from each jet. The variation is of concern for the initial detumble of NEA Scout upon deployment from SLS when body rates could be as high as 10 deg/sec on each axis. A number of cases were run to simulate the detumble maneuver with different combinations of deviations in the magnitude and direction of the thrust. In the worst documented case, the fuel usage of the RCS was four times greater than the nominal case. However, considering the total amount of fuel used, any excess fuel consumption during detumble resulting from manufacturing variations would not severely impact the mission. Time to detumble was not significantly altered by the thrust variation in the RCS. 2. A decrease in the specular reflectivity coefficient caused by meso-scale sail wrinkling will result in a larger solar torque on the spacecraft. Modeling of the decreased specular reflection in the full spacecraft model showed that the increased solar torque will not significantly impact the mission across the range of expected operating solar incidence angles because the solar torques can be adequately managed by the AMT and RCS. Even the lowest possible specular reflection value would not result in a failure to complete the mission objectives. However, more research needs to be done to characterize the optical properties of the entire sail. 3. Passive roll control by means of oscillation about a stable equilibrium angle is possible for NEA Scout. Above a 20\\u02da sun incidence angle, there are specific clock angles around which the spacecraft oscillates rather than continuing to roll and build up z-axis (roll) momentum. If a stable clock angle is attained, the RCS will not be required to activate to desaturate the roll momentum of the RW. By utilizing passive roll control, the sail can be stabilized in roll without the need for the RCS to desaturate the reaction wheels. Moreover, if the spacecraft is initially at an unstable clock angle, it can be placed into a stable attitude with a relatively minor firing of the RCS jets. Overall, this option would reduce fuel usage when compared to the current concept of operations which specifies frequent firings of the RCS to desaturate the RW roll momentum. 4. Reflective control devices (RCD) are a feasible option for controlling the sail without fuel consumption. These RCDs would be composed of polymer dispersed liquid crystal (PDLC) films with changeable optical properties. By positioning one RCD pair on each boom, an in-plane (x-axis and y-axis) control torque can be generated to counteract the solar torque. Furthermore, by tilting the RCDs at an angle to the sail, a roll control torque can be generated allowing for all control of the torque on all three axes of the spacecraft. The total weight and power cost of the RCDs for a sail the size of NEA Scout is well within practical consideration. 5. In the event of a complete loss of computer systems, the sail will reverse with the back side facing towards the sun because the spacecraft is not statically stable. This will result in severe deformation of the booms and will set the sail oscillating from the back and the front at a body rate up to 0.2 deg/sec. In order to recover from this situation, a safe mode was defined as using the RCS to point the spacecraft at the sun relying on the IMU body rates to inform the G&C software. The fuel consumption and time to implement this maneuver should not affect the mission for a single occurrence. 6. The Blue Canyon Technology sun sensors supplied to the NEA Scout mission need to be tested for accuracy and compatibility with the software. Initial testing has shown the sensors are correctly configured and the data inputs can be interpreted by the control software. Further testing to characterize the accuracy of the sun sensors has been defined. Although these investigations covered a wide range concerns, they are but a small subset of the tasks that comprise the validation and verification of a system as complex as a spacecraft. The results of the documented studies have proved that the G&C software which manages the ACS is robust and can successfully carry out all mission objectives. The development of the NEA Scout software is nearing completion and these results have provided the team with confidence that the control model will be able to execute its responsibilities. The ground assessment and examination phase while shortly be finished and the ultimate test of the engineering will come with the launch of Near Earth Asteroid Scout on SLS Exploration Mission One.

A review of A Culture of Fear: Why Americans are Afraid of the Wrong Things One Sentence Summary: At the safest and most prosperous time in US history, Americans have been driven into a state of perpetual fear by a constant stream of dire news and politicians eager to take advantage of a wary populace. In the midst of the McCarthy communism scare, pioneering American journalist Edward Murrow told the nation on See It Now, \\u201cWe will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men.\\u201d Murrow\\u2019s words seem to have been all but forgotten today, with daily news shows providing us with a litany of scares to keep us up at night and politicians running exclusively on fear-driven platforms \\u2014 fear of outsiders, fear of the future, fear of the upper class, fear of the lower class, and most concerning, fear of each other. Yet, even as Americans report feeling less secure, the country is demonstrably becoming a safer place to live. (One typical example: In 2014, over 60% of Americans estimated that crime was increasing when actually, violent crime has dropped 50% since 1991.) What has created and maintained this misconception of a more dangerous world that runs counter to all statistics? In A Culture of Fear, Barry Glassner attempts to answer this question with an illuminating trip through a number of recent scares created and spread throughout the American consciousness. A Culture of Fear was first published in 1999 and as a result, the majority of the focus is on panic \\u201cepidemics\\u201d from the 1990s, including violent children, teen moms, rap music, and plane crashes. While some of these fears remain prevalent (CNN\\u2019s theme seems to be \\u201cnever let a good plane crash go unreported\\u201d), I was struck by how little I had heard of some of the others. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS) and Road Rage, bogus afflictions said to be affecting large swathes of the American population two decades ago, have barely crossed my radar and never been presented as serious issues. Gradually, I realized that this only served to underscore the fleeting nature of these manufactured fears. They have disappeared because they never existed in the first place. Once the public eventually catches on, rather than retract the story, the media simply moves on to the next event sure to \\u201cend civilization as we know it.\\u201d The motto of modern news organizations is best described as \\u201calarm, confuse, manipulate.\\u201d Alarm the public about a false danger, confuse them with misleading statistics or none at all, and manipulate them into consuming ever-greater amounts of coverage and supporting whichever political party the media happens to be aligned with. Although most of the fears described may not be salient today, the way they are generated by the media and then maintained in the face of all evidence is the heart of the book. As Glassner explains, there are four required ingredients for an epidemic of panic: Reporters are able to an take isolated incident, say a child is arrested after bringing a knife to school because of a movie he/she watched, and turn it into an epidemic on a nationwide scale: \\u201cKnife-toting child shows the sad state of American youth.\\u201d The scare plays into already-formed preconceptions about the world at large and targets a group without the ability or the resources to correct the mis-belief (in this case, the preconception is that the next generation is severely degraded, a view expressed perennially since Roman times). Moreover, the story often obscures mundane but critical issues that deserve coverage such as the under-funding of public education. News organizations pick up on the story and seek out other incidents to cover in order to demonstrate the trend. This is a direct contradiction of the scientific method. Rather than observing the evidence and drawing a conclusion based on facts, reporters form a story and then pick out the evidence to support their conclusion, ignoring all the vast amounts of contradictory statistics. One point repeatedly stressed throughout the book is that \\u201canecdote trumps facts.\\u201d In other words, an emotional story will always move viewers more than hard statistics even when the numbers show the disproportionate amount of fear we attribute to relatively harmless, even safe, activities. One example that bears mentioning is that in the entire history of commercial aviation, about half as many people have been killed in plane crashes as are killed every year in the United States in motor vehicles. The common refrain that the most dangerous part of any international trip is the drive to the airport is perfectly accurate. Nonetheless, the media is able to stoke people\\u2019s relatively minor qualms about flying (claustrophobia or a fear of heights) into massive panic conflagrations with an incessant amount of coverage when a plane so much as lands heavily. On the exceedingly rare occasion when a plane accident does end in fatalities, the media focuses not on the larger trends that show how anomalous the crash is, but on families and individuals that have been affected by the accident. Glassner does not deny that any death is indeed a tragedy for those affected, but he points out that there are no similarly touching stories for the common events that actually kill a majority of Americans, such as heart disease or problems that evolve on a much longer time-scale, such as a widening gap in income levels. Furthermore, positive news stories that would show how much forward progress humanity has made never elicit even a mention. \\u201cAnother plane lands safely: that\\u2019s 25 million in a row\\u201d does not make for an exciting headline even though it was true during 2007 and 2008 when not a single passenger was killed by an airplane in the US. This period was noticeably bereft of coverage of planes precisely because they were too reliable. However, the frenzy started back up again in 2009 at the first crash of an airplane, demonstrating the classic cycle of fear: people are evolutionary inclined to be cautious about the world and place greater weight on negative news, the media is all too glad to provide numerous stories of suffering to feed these worries, and the public becomes even more afraid. The fearful public must then watch the nightly news for the next thing to be scared of. We suffer from an overload of information resulting in an increased exposure to a decreasing number of bad things that happen in the world. As Glassner and others have pointed out, it is not the rate of violent crime and suffering that have increased, it is only our perception of these events. Why Should We Care? The Culture of Fear may seem like a glum book, and it is for large parts. However, Glassner makes sure to point out times when journalism did its job by highlighting causes that would have gone unnoticed and ensuring that they were addressed. During the 1980s and 1990s, drunk driving received extensive media coverage, which combined with the efforts of groups such as Mothers Against Drunk Driving, led to a 31% decline in the number of alcohol related highway fatalities. Research showed that the rate fell faster in years with more coverage, indicating the public is willing to change their behavior with enough coverage and the right message. Journalism and media coverage should unite us in our common interests \\u2014 namely health, prosperity, and sustainability \\u2014 rather than alienate us against outsiders and one another. Moreover, news organizations need to serve as a barrier to the abuse of power by highlighting unsavory practices (see Bernstein and Woodward and their investigation of some suspicious events at the Watergate Hotel) and fully covering the impact of legislation. Lately however, it has seemed that rather than being a check on politicians, the media has become a tool used by political parties to manipulate a public only too willing to be led to supposed \\u201csafety.\\u201d Like it or not, the media has an exceedingly influential hold on our nation, especially in the political arena. In 2004, during the presidential campaign, the Bush administration pressured the head of the Department of Homeland Security, Tom Ridge, to raise the nation\\u2019s threat level because they had noticed that it correlated with the sitting President\\u2019s approval rating. Increasingly, we are being fed only the news we want to see and hearing only one side of a discussion, political or otherwise. Facebook shows us stories and posts based on what we have liked in the past, and even a simple Google search is influenced by your click history. We unquestioningly accept these stories partly because its much easier to think something is true if we agree with it (a phenomenon known as confirmation bias). This division of every issue is an us vs. them, right vs. wrong dichotomy is detrimental because it does not even allow one to take the point of view of the other side. As Glassner mentions in the last chapter of the book, added 10 years after the original publishing, the fears of the 1990s were almost exclusively directed at other groups within our society. In the years post 9/11, our fears shifted to a distrust of any outsiders which at least temporarily slowed down our increasing distrust of our fellow citizens. Yet, now it appears that we are beginning to turn our fears inward again, except that this time the target is not small subsets of the population, but the entire \\u201cother side.\\u201d There is still hope to reverse this trend though. There are many large problems to be addressed in the 21st century, and perhaps we can unite behind these endeavors. The first step is to turn off the news and concentrate on the larger issues and real trends that will shape our society on a long-term timescale. At the very least, consume any media with a more skeptical attitude, particularly when real-world statistics do not align with the story. As a public, we must demand that journalism return to its original purpose of holding power in check and covering stories that need to be addressed.In the end, we must remember that the news is not a bastion of truth, but a manufactured product that is designed to take advantage of human psychology and keep us watching without questioning. It is only by recognizing that the content we see is designed by an organization with an agenda, that we can take a step back, examine the situation, and make decisions based not on fear, but on rationality. Recommendation When evaluating non-fiction I tend not to give a book a rating out of ten or a number of stars (or whatever shape happens to be in vogue). Rather, I like to ask the question: did I get anything more out of reading the whole book than I could have gotten from a ten-minute summary? My opinion is that some books are important for the content itself, but some books are only useful for the big idea. In the case of A Culture of Fear, even though the main idea was easy to grasp, I found that finishing the book was still beneficial and I would recommend reading through it all. Although most of the examples are somewhat dated, each offered a different perspective and lessons on the architecture of an artificial panic. Moreover, the final additional chapter, added in 2009, was more relevant, with a focus on terrorism and other fears in the early years of the 21st century. The additional chapter also presented some notes of optimism as it discusses the election of Barack Obama, a decidedly anti-fear candidate who ran on the message of hope, the antidote to fear. Although recent events have again highlighted the power of fear in motivating voters, I do not think it is evidence of our society sliding backwards into an \\u201cage of unreason.\\u201d Rather, I think that rational decision making can reassert itself but it will take a concerted effort by the public to demand a higher level of journalist integrity from our news organizations. The book concludes with a powerful message that shows where we should place our aspirations thanks to a quote from Michelle Obama when asked why she let Barack run for President: We can escape from the fear-driven cycle with an application of conscious logic when making our decisions. The next time you go to the ballot box or decide to drive rather than fly, ask yourself, am I making this decision out of fear, or because it is the best choice for myself and the country? Part 1 of the Optimist\\u2019s Guide to the 21st Century The next time you sit down to dinner, start off the conversation with the statement: \\u201cThe world today is more peaceful, more prosperous, and healthier than at any point in human civilization.\\u201d Wait a few seconds for it to sink in, and then ride out the inevitable storm of protestations, most of which will begin with: \\u201cWell today on the news I heard\\u2026\\u201d or \\u201cI saw a picture in the paper the other day\\u2026\\u201d While the commotion roils, take solace in the knowledge that your statement is entirely correct. Once the uproar has subsided, pull out this article, and slowly begin to turn everyone\\u2019s world upside down. Indeed, any way you look at it, humans today are better off than at any other point in history. This is the first in an indeterminate number (I\\u2019ll put the bounds at one and infinity) of articles about the drastic improvement in the human condition throughout history. It is designed to get past the surface-level stories of constant strife we hear reported in the press and take a fact-based look at the current and historical state of human affairs. When two years ago, I began reading deeper into the large scale trends surrounding humanity, I expected to find a roller-coaster graph of human living conditions over time with large drops and rises, and the modern world in a particularly deep trough. What I discovered instead is that the story has been a gradual increase with a dramatic acceleration in the latter half of the 20th century (what is called exponential growth). These startling realities led to a change in my worldview and I gradually adopted a positive outlook for the future of humanity (I like to say I\\u2019m a short-term realist but a long-term optimist). My intention is not convert anyone with this series, but rather to encourage readers to take a deeper look at the state of our world beyond the headlines. Grand Scale Improvements Let\\u2019s start our examination on the grand scale of all of human history. As Yuval Harari writes in his non-fiction work Homo Deus: A Brief History of Tomorrow, for the entirety of human existence up until the last few decades, humans were occupied on a daily basis with the \\u201cBig Three\\u201d problems of famine, plague, and war. Yet, in the 21st century, we can look back and realize that we have, for the most part, vanquished all three of these issues. As Harari summarizes, \\u201cFor the first time in history, more people die today from eating too much than from eating too little; more people die from old age than from infectious diseases; and more people commit suicide than are killed by soldiers, terrorists and criminals combined.\\u201d The average human today is far more likely to die from the problems of overabundance than from a wheat shortage, ISIS attack, or Ebola outbreak. However, bold claims such as these are meaningless by themselves. In order to give these statements value, it is time to take a journey through the numbers that demonstrate the extent to which we have solved our largest historical challenges. A nice dinner-table worthy opening point is plagues, the invisible killer that has decimated human populations again and again. (In this case, decimate is not a strong enough word as it comes from the Roman military practice of killing one of every ten soldiers as a form of discipline). Diseases spread by Europeans to the New World starting in the 1500s routinely killed up to 90% of the native inhabitants, notably in the Aztecs and Mayans in central America. As an example, the native population in Hawaii decreased from half a million to 70,000 individuals within 80 years of James Cook first setting foot in the islands. Native peoples had no biological defenses against diseases they could not see let alone comprehend. Humanity in the 21st century however, is no longer helpless in the face of pathogens. Modern medicine has allowed us to prevent numerous diseases, significantly mitigate the effects of the diseases that we do catch, and wipe some plagues off the face of the Earth. Smallpox, the disease that more than any other factor may have been responsible for the Spanish conquest of Central America, was eradicated by humanity in 1979 thanks to a monumental global vaccination campaign overseen by the World Health Organization. Measles and Polio are next on the way out. In 1988, when the campaign to eradicate polio was launched, there were 350,000 new cases per year. In 2016, there were 37. It is possible that in 2017, the world will see its last ever case of polio. The reduction in global infectious disease deaths has occurred even as the world has become more connected , seemingly predisposing us to more disease outbreaks. Nonetheless, the outbreaks that do occur today are on a much smaller scale and cause far less damage than any historical plagues. Take the Ebola outbreak that lasted for 18 months in 2014\\u20132016 and was accompanied by hysterical cries of doom and calls to shut down international travel. The entire Ebola outbreak infected only 30,000 individuals (4 in the United States) and only 11,000 individuals perished. This is 1/3 of number of people killed in the United States in automobile accidents every year. The global response to the outbreak was incredibly effective, and in December 2016, a vaccine was released with 100% efficacy. This transformation of what once would have been a catastrophic event for entire human civilizations into a minor regional flare-up is a testament to the amazing capabilities of modern medicine and to the rapid international response enabled by collaboration between government agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs). As we move forward in the 21st century, we must remain vigilant about the possibility of plagues, but we can take solace that we are no longer helpless in the face of disease. The second scourge in the triumvirate of human problems is famine. The default state of nearly all human societies up until the last decades of the 20th century was food vulnerability. One bad season or poor planting decision could lead to the starvation of millions of individuals. Historically, famines killed significant percentages of even well-established agricultural societies. For example, from 1692\\u2013194 in France, nearly 15% of citizens perished in a famine that resulted from two years of uncooperative weather. The same conditions killed one-fifth of all individuals in 1695 in Estonia. Famines have repeatedly struck every type of society with devastating results, particularly for the poorest individuals. However, in the last 50 years, a global network of government agencies, NGOs, and private insurance agencies have constructed a robust food security network that has made it exceedingly unlikely that famines will effect large swaths of a population. A poor harvest, or even multiple seasons of unfavorable growing conditions no longer spell doom for a society. In fact, the greater problem in the modern world is one of overabundance. While starvation/malnutrition led to the deaths of slightly under 1 million individuals in 2010, obesity related diseases killed over 3 million people. The \\u201cgreen revolution\\u201d and the miracle of modern agriculture (including Genetically Modified Organisms which have allowed us to feed more people cheaper than ever before with less environmental impact) have allowed humanity to move away from the default state of food insecurity. Today, we live in a world where just 2% of the population is able to feed the other 98% and farming now produces 2.5 times the amount of food as in 1950 with fewer inputs. In fact, collectively, the world produces enough food to feed everyone on the planet and the issue remains only in the distribution of nutrition. As with plagues, we have not eradicated hunger completely, but there are numerous plans in action that will soon allow us to cross famine off humanity\\u2019s collective to-do list. Finally, we must address what is sure to be the most controversial point of this article: humanity has reduced the extent and impact of violent conflict to a new low. This may be nearly impossible to fathom in our seemingly conflict-obsessed society, but a careful examination of history proves that this is the case. Throughout all of human history, the accepted state between different groups of humans has been conflict. Yuval Harari describes this as the \\u201cLaw of the Jungle\\u201d: even if two groups were temporarily at peace, war was always an acceptable option for resolving conflicts. Times of peace were viewed as temporary interludes between conflicts. Now however, the narrative has flipped and the 21st century is on track to be the most peaceful century in human existence. Moreover, the 20th century, even with 2 global conflicts and numerous regional conflicts, was the most peaceful century in all of history. That point bears repeating: The 20th century was the most peaceful century in human existence. As Steven Pinker details in his book The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined, war killed at least 15% of the population in antiquity, 5% of the population in the 20th century, and less than 1% of the population since the turn of the millennium. On every conceivable scale, from human civilizations to individuals, from millennium down to single years, violence is on the decline. The global death rate from violence has fallen from 500 per 100,000 individuals in prestate societies to less than 1 in developed nations. Homicide rates in most parts of the developed world have fallen by 100 times in the past six centuries. The image of peaceful native peoples in ancient times and brutish, ruthless modern humans is flipped. Since 2002, the proportion of youth involved in violent behavior has fallen by 29% according to a study from the American Journal of Public Health. Even the threat of terrorism is miniscule; terrorists from the seven nations included in the administration\\u2019s recent travel ban killed 0 Americans from 1975\\u20132015. For Americans, fast-food restaurants pose a much greater danger to your health than al-Qaeda. As Harari bluntly puts it: \\u201cSugar is now more dangerous than gunpowder.\\u201d Countries no longer turn to violence as the first method for solving problems, and democratic countries nearly never go to war with each other. Increasingly, the global economy has come to rely on trade between nations, and this connectedness means it does not make sense to invade your neighbor when they are the ones feeding your citizens. Posturing between some of the most powerful nations on Earth may at the moment seem frightening, but it is nothing more than bluffing. Countries and leaders have matured to the point (well with one notable exception) where resolutions are worked out in boardrooms with lawyers armed with expensive pens and large vocabularies rather than soldiers with well-honed swords. The massive improvements that humanity has collectively made, particularly in the past 50 years, raises a critical question: If the examination of reality demonstrates that we live in a more peaceful age than ever before, why does no one believe that to be the case? To address this query, think back to the dinner table situation I outlined at the beginning of the article. The first objection anyone will make to the claims of worldwide peace, prosperity, and health is that they have repeatedly heard the exact opposite from various sources. In our modern world, we are exposed to more news and information in a single day than our distant ancestors would have been over the course of their entire lifetime. Therefore, we should easily be able to ascertain the historical and present-day realities and come to the realization that life really is getting better for the majority of humanity. However, access to information does not mean that we are in fact better informed. (In the words of Mark Twain: \\u201cIf you don\\u2019t read the newspaper, you\\u2019re uninformed. If you read the newspaper, you\\u2019re mis-informed.\\u201d) Unfortunately, bad news sells much better than good news. Humans, whether we like it or not, are evolutionarily wired to pay more attention to negative news and to adopt a pessimistic worldview. Our ancestors on the savannah who saw a lion hiding behind every rock were much more likely to survive and pass on their genes than the hominids who stopped to appreciate the beauty of nature. In addition to the evolutionary benefits of adopting a negative outlook, stories of tragedy and woe are more intriguing to us as social creatures. There is considerably more gossip to be derived from a break-up than from a happy marriage. (How many times have you started a conversation about a postive aspect of your co-workers?). It does not take a trained psychologist to notice these human tendencies, and media companies are well-aware of our predisposition to negative information. Therefore, when we turn on the television or the radio (people still do that right?), is it any surprise that we are inundated with stories of murder, conflict, and tragedy? It is not the number of violent incidents that are on the rise, but the coverage of these events. As humans are mere reflections of their environment, it is inevitable that we will come to adopt the negative attitude encouraged by these stories. Surveys repeatedly show that Americans believe violent crime is on the rise even as the rates of crime have dropped precipitously. The negativity cycle is self-perpetrating: we are naturally inclined to pay attention to bad news, the media shows us negative news stories, and our attitudes become even more pessimistic. Over time, we adopt false belief that the world is becoming a worse place to live. Indeed, ask Americans what they think about the world, and they will say that the country is not improving. This cycle is a prime example of what is known as the representativeness bias.(This is also referred to as the representativeness heuristic where a heuristic means a rule of thumb that we adopt as a mental shortcut when we are forced to make a rapid decision). The idea is that humans judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily they can call to mind examples of the event. Therefore, when people are asked to judge the chance that they will be murdered or die in a terrorist attack, they vastly overstate the true probability because of all the attention the media gives to these extremely rare events. Violence, poverty, famine, plague, and war continue to decrease on a yearly basis while conversely, the coverage and saturation of these events grows ever more prevalent. The other major reason for the public unwillingness to believe in the overall improvement in the human condition is that people need to believe they are engaged in a great struggle. It gives our lives meaning if we think that we are overcoming unimaginable odds to achieve success. In the modern United States, we do not do battle against war, plague, and famine on a daily basis. Instead, we are forced to create a mental image of a terrible and frightening world so we can feel like we are triumphing in the face of extreme difficulties. Humans have been in a constant struggle for survival for 99% of our existence, and now that the pressures of starvation and conflict have been lifted from our daily life, we feel lost. To compensate, we generate a fictional representative of the world in which we are still locked in a fight to make it through each day. To accept the truth that the world is actually getting better means to give up this fantasy and admit that our lives are easier than ever before. It requires that we no longer have the defining scourges of war, plague, and famine to do constant battle against. (This raises the interesting possibility that we could replace the \\u201cBig 3\\u201d with something equally worthwhile such as solving climate change, developing genetic engineering, and creating beneficial artificial intelligence). The statement \\u201cmay you live in interesting times\\u201d is often presented as a curse, but I believe that many people instead see it as a blessing. People want to experience monumental events during their lifetime, even when those events are monumentally negative. In short, we believe that the world is on the decline because it gives us something to argue about at the dinner table. How Should We Respond? What should we do now that we are aware of this privileged information? What steps can we take in our life to make sure that the trend of general improvement in the human condition continues? The critical part is that we do not sit back and relax now that we know humanity is on the right track. All of these improvements, from the reduction in the extent of famine, to the eradication of diseases has not come about automatically. These problems have been systematically addressed through a combination of science, medicine, and evolution of society\\u2019s collective morals. The solutions have been achieved through the work of millions of individuals who took the long term view rather than trying to maximize short-term rewards. We must carry on in this tradition by focusing on our strengths (science, medicine, arts) and suppressing our weakness (pessimism, the desire for vengeance). We have to realize that our efforts, both as individuals and as nations really do make a difference. Moreover, by improving the lives and increasing the prosperity of citizens in all nations, we benefit ourselves. By eradicating and controlling disease in developing countries, we immunize ourselves against a global pandemic. By donating food to countries currently struggling with shortages, we can gain valuable trading partners far in the future. And by working to prevent violence in all countries, we stabilize the entire world and keep our citizens safe (even safer than we already are). When we view the world as one connected community, we realize that improving the life of even one individual in another country raises the standard of living for all of humanity. One practical step you can take with this information is simply to spread it. The next time you hear a negative news story or a relative brings up a tragedy they heard, gently remind them that these stories only make it into the public consciousness because they are anomalies. Remind them that since 1990, the global extreme poverty rate has been cut in half. One billion less people live in extreme poverty today than did 25 years ago. Furthermore, the childhood mortality rate has decreased by 50% since 1990 thanks to advances in infant care, education, and access to trained medical experts. 86% of children born around the world today receive basic vaccines, the highest figure ever. The next time someone raises an objection to foreign aid, inform them that every dollar the United States invests in vaccination returns $44 in economic benefits to our economy. (Preceding facts are taken from Bill Gate\\u2019s 2017 annual letter). I could go on for pages, but I will leave that exercise for another article. Communicate to those around you that we have conquered war, famine, and plague, and are making progress on all fronts towards a more prosperous, equitable, and sustainable worldwide civilization. Talk to people, make them aware of these facts, and then work to make the statistics even better. When politicians campaign on promises of decreasing foreign aid and diverting it to the military, citing the threat of conflict, remind your neighbor that in fact, armed conflict is decreasing thanks in no small part foreign aid. Remind your friends and your family that we have less to fear than ever before and as a country need we should reflect that in our investment and priorities. And finally, stop being a cog in the fear-mongering news cycle. I took a sabbatical from the traditional news two years ago and I have not gone back since. I diverted more time to reading about what is actually going on in the world rather than what the media presented to me. Yes, I may not be able to participate in all the recent gossip or bemoan the most recent tragedy, but I can discourse at length on the polio eradication campaign and the massive improvements in global agriculture production. I will delve into the full impacts of my news-free lifestyle in a future article, but for now, I will leave you with this: I believe that switching off the news has made me a better informed citizen and more aware of both my individual biases and the collective biases of our society. I am more empathetic, less anxious about the world at large, and I have more meaningful conversations with my fellow humans once we get past the surface level stories that dominate the headlines. At the end of the day, the narrative we tell ourselves about the world we inhabit is the only thing that matters. Would you rather live in a tragedy, or in a triumphant story that reflects the reality of the 21st century? Will When the Health of the Environment and the Health of Your Wallet Align According to Malcolm Gladwell\\u2019s bestselling nonfiction work Outliers, it takes 10,000 hours to achieve world-class expertise in a field such as playing an instrument or becoming a professional athlete. Based on this logic, one LED lightbulb could accompany you through the process of becoming a concert-level piano player, learning to speak French like a native, and then halfway to making it as a professional tennis player. As incredible as it may seem, the average LED lightbulb is rated to last for a minimum of 25,000 hours, or in practical terms, 22.8 years at 3 hours of usage per day. If you want the same duration of light from incandescent bulbs with an average lifetime of 1,000 hours, you will have to interrupt your studying to swap bulbs 25 times. You have probably seen LED lightbulbs and even thought about making the switch on your last trip to the local hardware store. However, like many of us, you were probably put off by the high cost of LEDs and decided to stick with the same incandescent bulb that Thomas Edison would still recognize over 130 years after its invention (I have to mention that Edison did not invent the lightbulb but only figured out how to sell them in the classic example of the value of a good marketing campaign). Why pay up to 10 times the price for a bulb that produces the exact same amount of light? On my latest trip to Ace, I decided to work out if I was missing anything by not making the switch to LED. Quickly, I realized the enormous short-sighted error I was making. Take the humble and ubiquitous 60-watt lightbulb. My choice seemed relatively simple; I could pick up an incandescent for $0.50 (a 20-pack was just $10) or I could get a 60-watt equivalent LED bulb for $1.50 (4 for $6). The price discrepancy was much lower than I remembered from a couple years ago, but the LED was still 3 times the up-front price. Nevertheless, to get the full story, I did the simple math to work out the lifetime cost of each bulb. The LED, while putting out the exact same light intensity and color, uses only 9.5 watts which equates to $1.14 in electricity costs per year (based on 3 hours/day). Meanwhile, the incandescent bulb only converts 2.2% of the energy it receives into usable light (the rest is lost as heat) and consequently costs $7.23/year. Let\\u2019s see what that equates to over the lifetime of the bulb. I\\u2019ll go easy on the incandescent and assume that the LED lasts for only 20 years. The total cost to purchase and operate the 60-watt LED bulb for two decades works out to $24.30. The same light production from incandescent bulbs, which last for only a year of daily use, will require 20 bulbs and cost $154.60. (An interesting side note is that early incandescent lightbulb manufacturers formed a cartel and limited the lifetime of bulbs in order to sell larger quantities). That means a single LED bulb will save you over $130 over its two-decade lifetime. Standing in the hardware store, I had what can only be described as an epiphany as I realized how much cash I had been throwing away through short-term thinking. Now, perhaps that is not persuasive enough. What\\u2019s $130 spread out over 20 years worth to you? I knew that I could not stop my analysis at merely a single bulb. Based on surveys, the average American household has 45 lightbulbs in daily use (take a moment to go and count. I was astonished to discover this was actually the case). Assuming these average out to 60 watts each, switching to all LEDs will save $490 in energy costs each year. That works out to a staggering total of $5863.50 over the next two decades. If pocketing a free six grand is not an enticement, imagine having to replace all 900 of those incandescents compared to the one-time installation of the 45 LEDs. Taking matters as far as we can, let\\u2019s consider the 126 million households in the United States. If all incandescent bulbs were switched to LEDs today (perhaps we can have a one-time national lightbulb switching holiday?), over the next 20 years, US households would save almost $740 billion and 111 billion lightbulbs. Oftentimes, when it comes to talking about climate change, either the narratives are so depressing that people lose hope and believe their individual actions to be meaningless, or the audience is not responsive to environmental arguments and unwilling to make lifestyle changes for some intangible benefits at some point in the distant future. The light bulb example is not some abstract calculation involving megatons of CO2 reduced or inches of sea level rise prevented 150 years from now. It is about you being able to afford one (or perhaps two) more family vacations over the next 20 years because you made the simple step of changing your light bulbs. This is about real money staying in American pockets rather than lining the walls of a Saudi Arabian oil tycoon (or in reality buying another mansion for an Exxon CEO). Who is going to make the extra effort of recycling or incur the added cost of buying an electric car if the effects will not be felt for generations? However, when it comes to making personal or household decisions, you will find that the environmentally sound choice often aligns with the best interests of your wallet. Switching lightbulbs might be the most actionable example, but there are plenty of others from eating less meat to walking more (both of which will not only improve your health and that of the environment, but also cost far less over the long term than the alternative). The problem with these decisions is that, as in the case of LED lightbulbs, the upfront costs of implementing a change can obscure the benefits of a smart investment. Of course, I encourage anyone to consider the lasting impact to the Earth when making a purchasing decision or changing daily habits, but if that does not appeal to you, then I urge you to take the time to figure out the true economic cost of the options. More often than not, you will find that \\u201csaving the environment\\u201d aligns nicely with keeping your wallet \\u201cfull of Benjamins.\\u201d Author\\u2019s Note: I was inspired to write this post after my experience a few months ago with a house owner from whom I was renting. I noticed that every single bulb in his house was incandescent and he kept them on almost constantly. After hearing him complain yet another time that he had to replace the darn things twice a year, I decide to make the polite suggestion that LEDs were a better choice for the environment. He scoffed and said (although not so politely): \\u201cScrew the environment. That\\u2019s not for me to worry about; I\\u2019m sure the polar bears can find somewhere else to live.\\u201d (He did refrain from calling me a socialist environmental-terrorist which I thought was a nice gesture). I took a while off from the topic and thought about my approach. The next time the issue came up when another two bulbs had burned out, I made the LED suggestion again, but this time I couched my recommendation in cold economic terms. I mentioned the cost-savings and the lifetime advantage of LEDs, and reluctantly he agreed to make the switch in several fixtures. After a month with the new bulbs, he was prepared to accept that they did indeed produce the same comforting light as incandescents and of course none had burned out. At that point, he decided to go full in (this was not a man to do anything halfway) and replaced every single bulb in his house with LEDs. After two months with no complaints and not a single replacement, I thought nothing more of the matter. Then, one day, he triumphantly pulled out his electricity bills and showed me the year-over-year comparisons by month. His electricity costs had decreased by an astounding $40 per month under the same exact conditions and with no conscious effort on his part to reduce usage. He said that he had even convinced many of his friends (all people to whom saving the environment was about as meaningful as taking a vacation to Jupiter) to do the same and he had heard only positive responses. At this point, it finally dawned on me, people may not care about conserving natural resources, but when it comes to an economic argument, there can be no reason to campaign for less money in American pockets. Now, any time an environmental subject arises, I keep all of my arguments in terms of proven economic facts. I have found that people from all backgrounds are receptive to this approach and it often leads to productive dialogue about addressing climate change to order to strengthen the economy (for example by reducing dependence on foreign energy sources). I am optimistic about the future of renewable energy not because people are suddenly going to become tree-hugging environmentalists, but because new installations of renewable energy can now compete on a level playing field with fossil fuels. Rick Perry did not make Texas into the US leader in wind energy because he wants to preserve the Earth for his grandchildren, he did it because it made economic sense. There are numerous challenges remaining in the switch to renewable energy, and I do not claim that technological progress will inevitably save us. Instead, I see reason to be optimistic that economic realities can accelerate the world\\u2019s move to sustainable energy production.

When people ask about the hardest part of my job as a data scientist, they often expect me to say building machine learning models. Given that all of our ML modeling is done in about 3 lines: I reply that machine learning is one of the easier parts of the job. Rather, the hardest part of being a data scientist in industry is the software engineering required to build the infrastructure that goes into running machine learning models continuously in production. Starting out, (at Cortex Building Intel) I could write a good Jupyter Notebook for a one-time machine learning project, but I had no idea what it meant to \\u201crun machine learning in production\\u201d let alone how to do it. Half a year in, and having built several ML systems making predictions around the clock to help engineers run buildings more efficiently, I\\u2019ve learned it takes a whole lot of software construction and a tiny bit of data science. Moreover, while there are not yet standard practices in data science, there are time-tested best practices for writing software that can help you be more effective as a programmer. With a relative lack of software engineering skills entering my job, I\\u2019ve had to learn quickly. Much of that came from interacting with other software engineers and soaking up their knowledge, but some of it has also come from resources such as textbooks and online tutorials. One of those textbooks is the 900-page masterwork on constructing quality software, Code Complete: A Practical Handbook of Software Construction by Steve McConnell. In this article, I wanted to outline the high-level points regarding software construction I took away from reading this book. These are as follows: Although the second edition of this book was written in 2004, the proven ideas in software engineering haven\\u2019t changed in the intervening years and the book is still highly relevant to software engineers today. You won\\u2019t learn any specific details about data science in Python from this book, but you will learn the fundamentals of how to plan, structure, build, test, and review software projects. I\\u2019ve tried to keep the ideas here at a fairly high-level and plan to go more into depth on specific points in later articles. While these practices may seem irrelevant to data science as it\\u2019s currently taught, I think data science is hurt by the current lack of emphasis on software engineering. After all, a machine learning system is a software project. If there are tested, best practices for delivering successful software projects, then we as data scientists should be practicing these methods to move beyond Jupyter Notebooks and start delivering machine learning solutions. The six topics covered here are not as exciting as the newest machine learning algorithm, but they are critical ideas for data scientists in industry. Just as you would never begin building a house without a blueprint, you should not start coding without a detailed, written design for your program. If you don\\u2019t know the intended outcome of your program, you will waste lots of time writing muddled code that accomplishes no particular objective. The problem I often ran into with regards to data science is that diving into a dataset is quite fun. It\\u2019s hard to resist the temptation to get your hands on the keyboard, making graphs, looking for anomalies, and hacking together models. After a few hours, you inevitably end up with a lot of messy code and no clear deliverable, a problem that could have been averted by taking the time to plan out your program. Every software project you take on \\u2014 and this includes machine learning models \\u2014 should start with a problem definition: a high-level statement of the problem to solve. An example from my work regarding a demand forecasting model is \\u201cWe want to predict building energy demand accurately 7 days in advance to help building engineers prepare for the next week.\\u201d This statement captures the desired outcome and the business value of the project. After the problem statement comes the project requirements, a set of objectives \\u2014at a lower level than the problem statement\\u2014 that a solution must meet. These can cover metrics \\u2014 an error of less than 10% \\u2014 or the end user experience \\u2014 graphs must clearly show best estimates and uncertainty. The requirements will guide the detailed design of your program and allow you to assess if the project is a success. After the description and requirements comes the architecture specification where you start planning out the files, classes, and routines (functions) that will make up your program. At this point, you can start getting into the details of your design such as error handling, input/output, user interface, and data flow through the program. These documents should be reviewed and discussed just as much as the actual code because errors and decisions made in the design phase affect the rest of the project. Here is where you need to understand what is being asked of your program, and how you will approach the problem. Plan out where you foresee difficulties, make time estimates for the project, outline alternative approaches, and assign responsibility during the design phase of a project, Only after everyone has agreed to the description, requirements, and architecture plan should you even think of hitting the keyboard. The exact steps above may change, but the important idea is that you should never start off a project by writing a bunch of code. Even on small, one-off personal data science projects, I now take the time to plan out \\u2014 and write down \\u2014 my overall goal and a set of requirements for my program. It\\u2019s a good habit to start; remember that large projects don\\u2019t arise out of people hacking away on a keyboard, they are planned out and built a piece at a time, following a detailed blueprint drawn up during the design process. At my current company, all of our machine learning projects involve a substantial design phase where we have discussions with the business side of the company, our clients, and customer success to make sure we meet the needs of our end users. This process usually ends up creating several dozen pages of documentation that we refer to throughout the rest of the project. While it\\u2019s true that requirements will change over the course of the project, it\\u2019s crucial to have a checklist of what you need your code to accomplish because otherwise you\\u2019ll just be hacking and building something that ultimately will not be useable. Design tends to take up about 30% of the average project time for us, a worthwhile investment. Planning and writing down our design ahead of time means that instead of purposelessly banging together hammers and nails when we start coding, we follow an outline and build a sturdy structure a piece at a time. 2. Write readable code because it\\u2019s read more than it\\u2019s written Code is going to be read many more times than it will be written, so never sacrifice read-time convenience \\u2014 how understandable your code is \\u2014 for write-time convenience \\u2014 how quickly you can write the code. Data science teaches some bad practices around code readability, most notably with variable names. While it might be obvious to you that X and y stand for features and target because you\\u2019ve seen this several hundred times, why not call the variablesfeatures and target to help those less familiar with ML syntax? Reading code should not be an exercise in trying to decipher the cryptic made-up language of whoever wrote it. Improving code readability means using descriptive names for functions, classes, data objects, and any variable in your program! As an example, never use i, j, and k for loop variables. Instead, use what they actually represent: row_index, column_index , and color_channel. Yes, it takes half a second more to type, but using descriptive variable names will save you, and anyone who reads your code, dozens of hours down the line when debugging or trying to modify the code. Here\\u2019s another example of non-descriptive variable names: This code also suffers from the use of \\u201cmagic\\u201d numbers: undefined constant values that describe something (a conversion, number of sensor reads, a rate, etc.) only no one can tell what because they just appear as if out of magic. You should never have a magic number in your code because they make programs impossible to understand, are a large cause of errors, and make updating these values difficult as you have to hunt for all the places they are used. Instead, take the below approach: The widgets_per_hour and price_per_widget should be function parameters, or named constants if they are used throughout your code (denoted by all capitals in Python). Now, anyone can understand this code, and it\\u2019s much easier to modify by changing parameter values. Other practices encompassed by the idea of making code readable are that the visual structure of your code should reflect the logical structure (for example when writing loops), that your comments should show the intent of code rather than just stating what the code does, minimizing the span and live time of a variable, grouping together related statements, avoiding overly complicated if-else statements, and keeping functions as short as possible. If you ever find yourself thinking \\u201cI\\u2019ll keep these variable names short to save time\\u201d or \\u201cI\\u2019ll go back and document this code when I\\u2019m done writing it\\u201d, stop, do your future self a favor, and make the code more readable. As McConnell emphasizes, readable code has a positive effect on all the following: I think the practice of writing tangled code in data science is a result of individuals developing code intended to run only a single time. While this might be fine for a personal project, in industry, code readability is much more valuable than how quickly you can put together a model. Much of the first code I wrote on the job is unintelligible even to me because I did not think about the people who would be reading it in the future. As a result, this code is not fit for production and sits languishing in unused branches on GitHub. Remember, don\\u2019t ever prioritize writing speed over reading comprehension. 3. Reduce the complexity of your programs to free mental capacity As emphasized throughout Code Complete, the primary imperative of software construction is to manage complexity. What does this mean? It\\u2019s about limiting the amount of information you have to hold in your head while programming and reducing arbitrary decisions. Instead of expanding your intellectual ability to write more complicated code, simplify your existing code to a level where you can understand it with your current intellect. As an example of limiting information to recall, consider the situation where you have 2 functions, one to email users and one to send them a text. If you want to make things really hard on yourself, you do the following: The problem with this code is that you have to remember which function corresponds to which method and the order of variables. A much better approach, resulting in fewer pieces of information to recall is: Now the function name describes exactly what the function does and the arguments are consistent so you don\\u2019t waste mental energy thinking about their order. The concept of consistency is crucial for reducing code complexity. The argument for having standards/conventions is you don\\u2019t have to make multiple small decisions about things tangentially related to coding such as formatting. Pick a standard and apply it across your entire project. Rather than worrying about what capitalization to use for variable names, apply the same rules to all variables in your project and you don\\u2019t have to make a decision. The choice of a standard often matters less than the actual standard itself so don\\u2019t get too caught up arguing about whether you should use 2 spaces or 4. Just pick one, set up your development environment to automatically apply it, and go to work. (I don\\u2019t want to get too into specific technologies, but if you use Python, I have to recommend the black autoformatter. This tool has completely solved our team\\u2019s issues with code formatting and styling. We set it up to auto format our code and never have to worry about the length of lines or whether we should put spaces after commas. I have it set to auto-run on save in vscode). Other ways you can reduce complexity is by, providing consistent interfaces to all your functions and classes (sklearn is a great example of this), using the same error handling method everywhere, avoiding deeply nested loops, adopting conventions when possible, keeping functions short. On the subject of functions, make sure that each function does a single task and does it well! The name of a function should be self-documenting and describe exactly the single action done by the function (like email_user). If you find yourself writing a function doc-string with the word \\u201cand\\u201d describing what the function does, you need to simplify the function. Shorter functions that do only one thing are easier to remember, easier to test, reduce the opportunity for errors, and allow for greater modifiability. You can\\u2019t really make yourself much smarter, but you can make your code much simpler, thereby freeing your mental resources to concentrate on solving tough issues. When explaining technical concepts, the mark of a master is not using complicated jargon, but using simple language that anyone can understand. Likewise, when writing code, an experienced developer\\u2019s code may perform a complex task, but it will hide that complexity allowing others to understand and build on it. It can be momentarily satisfying to write tricky code that only you understand, but eventually, you\\u2019ll realize that an effective programmer writes the simplest code. Reducing complexity increases code quality and limits the number of decisions you have to make so you can focus on the difficult parts of a program. 4. Test and review every line of code in a program Testing is one of the most-poorly-covered areas in data science education yet it\\u2019s absolutely crucial for production code. Even code written by professional programmers has 15\\u201350 errors in every 1000 lines of code. Testing is one of several techniques to try and find errors or, at the least, assert your program works as intended. Without testing, we cannot release our machine learning models into production due to the risk of unintended failures. One of the quickest ways to lose customers would be to have mission-critical code fail because it was not thoroughly tested. A good rule of thumb for testing (this technique is called structural basis testing) is you need one test for every if, for, while, and, or, elif if your code. At a minimum, you want to test every statement in a program at least once. Our codebase has testing for every function, from loading data, transforming data, feature engineering, modeling, predicting, storing predictions, generating model explanations, and validating models which together cover every line of code in our codebase. Testing deserves at least its own article (or probably book), but a good place to start is with Pytest. Fortunately, these modern libraries make setting up and developing tests much less tedious. Furthermore, you can set up pytest (or other frameworks) to automatically run your testing suite with every commit to GitHub through a Continuous Integration service like CircleCI. In addition to (not as a substitute for) testing, every line of code written for a project should be reviewed by multiple programmers. This can be through formal code inspections or informal code reviews where the purpose is to get multiple eyes on the code to flush out errors, check the code logic, enforce consistent conventions, and improve general code quality through feedback. Code reviews are some of the best opportunities to learn, especially if you are inexperienced. Experience is a great teacher, but it requires a long time to acquire. As a shortcut, you can let others hindsight \\u2014 the mistakes they\\u2019ve made \\u2014 be your foresight by listening to their constructive criticism. Also, when you know that others will look at your code in a review, it forces you to write better code (think about the difference in quality between the things you write in private and in public). Moreover, once you start thinking about the tests you need to run over your code, it improves initial code quality (some people even recommend writing tests before you write the code). On our team, we typically spend almost as long testing and reviewing code as we do writing it in the first place to make sure it does exactly what we want with no side effects. At first, this was incredibly frustrating \\u2014 my typical response was \\u201cI wrote the code and it ran once on my machine so why should I test it\\u201d \\u2014 before I realized all the errors I wasn\\u2019t catching in my code because I wasn\\u2019t testing it. Testing may be foreign to many data scientists, but it\\u2019s a proven and universal method in software engineering because it improves code quality and reduces errors. If you are working on an individual project, you can still add testing and solicit feedback. However, that sometimes can be hard so an alternative is to start contributing to open source. Most libraries, especially the major data-science ones, have strict testing and code review requirements. These may be intimidating at first, but realize that procedures exist for a reason \\u2014 to ensure that code continues running as intended \\u2014 and that you can\\u2019t get better without trying and failing. I think testing has been overlooked in data science because of the lack of deployed machine learning systems. You don\\u2019t need testing to compile a Jupyter Notebook, but you sure need testing when your code is helping to run the largest office buildings in Manhattan! 5. Be an egoless programmer Before every code review, I take time to tell myself: \\u201cyou\\u2019ve made some mistakes in your code. They are going to be pointed out in this review, but don\\u2019t take it personally. Own up to your mistakes and use this experience to learn how to become a better programmer.\\u201d I have to do this because I find it very hard to admit when I\\u2019m wrong and as with most people, I tend to have an initial negative reaction to criticism. However, over time, I\\u2019ve learned failing to admit you are wrong and need to change is one of the greatest blockers to getting better at coding (and at any activity). My interpretation of being an egoless programmer means accepting your failures as a chance to learn. Don\\u2019t take feedback on your code personally, and realize that others are genuinely trying to help in code reviews. Egoless programming also means being willing to let go of your beloved frameworks or standards when they become out of date (in other words, don\\u2019t be resistant to change). McConnell makes the point that software engineering is a field where 10 years of experience can be worse than 1 year if the person with more experience has not updated her knowledge since she started. The best tools are constantly changing \\u2014 especially in data science \\u2014 and standards can also change over time. This doesn\\u2019t mean jump ship for the newest technology immediately, but it does mean if there is a proven benefit to switching, then don\\u2019t be so set in your ways that you refuse to change. Software development is not a deterministic process, it is heuristic \\u2014 driven by rules of thumb \\u2014 and you have to be willing to try many different approaches rather than sticking with the exact same method. Sometimes this means abandoning one model when it\\u2019s clearly not working \\u2014 even if you\\u2019ve spent dozens of hours on it \\u2014 and accepting other\\u2019s solutions when they are demonstrably better than your own. To extend the \\u201cbuilding a house metaphor\\u201d from earlier, construction workers do not use a single tool \\u2014 the hammer \\u2014 to build a house. Instead, they have a complete toolbox full of different implements for the varied tasks involved in construction. Likewise, in software engineering, or data science, the person who only knows one method will not get very far. If you are an egoless programmer, you\\u2019ll be open to learning from others, respond constructively to feedback, and fill your toolbox with the appropriate techniques. You\\u2019ll get much farther much quicker by admitting your mistakes than by asserting you can never make them. 6. Iterate on your designs and repeatedly measure progress Software development (and data science) is fundamentally an iterative process. Great solutions do not emerge fully-formed from one individual\\u2019s fingers the first time they touch a keyboard. Rather, they are developed over long processes, with many repetitions of earlier stages as the design is refined and features are added. Writing good software requires a willingness to keep working at a problem, making code more readable, more efficient, and less error-prone over time by responding to feedback and thinking deeply about problems (sometimes the best tool is a pencil and paper for writing down your thoughts). Don\\u2019t expect to get things completely right the first time! Iteration \\u2014 and this is probably a familiar concept to data scientists \\u2014 should be informed by repeated measurements. Without measuring, you are effectively blind. How do you know whether an optimization increased the speed of your code? How do you know which parts of the code are the most error-prone? How do you know which features users spend the most time with? How do you know which parts of a project take the most time? The answer is that you collect data and analyze it. Based on the results, you then improve your approach on the next iteration. Throughout Code Complete, McConnell stresses the need for measurement to make better decisions. Whenever we see a process that could be made more efficient, we need to look for opportunities where a little data can help us optimize. For example, when I started tracking my time in my first few months on the job, I noticed I was spending more than 75% of my coding time on writing and debugging tests. This was an unacceptably large share, so I decided to spend time reading how to write good unit tests, practicing writing tests, and I started to think about the tests I would write before coding. As a result, I reduced the percent of time writing tests down to less than 50% and was able to spend more time understanding the problem domain (another critical aspect of data science that is hard to teach). The most important part of tracking data is to look at relative changes over time. In most cases, the absolute value of an observation is not as important as the change of that value relative to the last time you measured it. Noticed that your model performance has been decreasing over time? Well, maybe that\\u2019s because one of the building\\u2019s power meters has gone down and needs to be fixed. Tracking outcomes over time requires only setting up a system that records data and making sure someone is checking it periodically. Measurements should help inform all aspects of the software construction process from design to code tuning. When estimating how long a project will take, you should look at past estimates and see why they were inaccurate. If you want to try and optimize your code (always make sure your code is working before trying to improve the performance) you have to measure each incremental change. There are numerous examples in the book that point out supposed performance enhancements that actually had the opposite effect! If you don\\u2019t measure the effects of a change, you cannot know if what you are doing is really worthwhile. The goal of data science isn\\u2019t to collect data and build nice graphs, it\\u2019s to make better decisions and improve processes through data. You can apply this to your own work by tracking your development habits, figuring out where you are weakest, and focusing on that area for improvement. Track changes over time to make sure you\\u2019re headed in the right direction and course correct as often as necessary. We\\u2019ve walked through some of the key ideas on software construction at a high level and the next step is to put them into practice by actually writing (better) code. First, realize that you won\\u2019t be able to adopt these all at once: as with any profession, improving at coding takes time. (Peter Norvig has a great essay on how to learn to program in 10 years, a more realistic goal than \\u201clearning Python in 24 hours\\u201d.) Instead, focus on one or two ideas at a time, and try to put them into practice either at work or on personal projects. If you have the opportunity to learn from others at work, then take full advantage of that (assuming they are using best practices) by adopting an egoless attitude. If you are learning on your own, take a look at getting involved with open source. There are plenty of projects looking for help. If that\\u2019s a little intimidating, you can try just reading some of the code in well-written libraries. (Some Python examples listed in the Hitchhiker\\u2019s Guide to Python are: Flask, Werkzeug, Requests, and Diamond). The overall theme I took away from the 900+ pages of Code Complete is that quality software is produced through a rigorous design and development process. That rigor is often missing from data science, which tends towards convoluted code to get a solution once, rather than code that can be run millions of times without error. Many people who come into data science \\u2014 myself included \\u2014 lack the formal training in computer science and software engineering best practices. However, these programming practices are relatively simple to pick up and will pay off far down the road in terms of your ability to write production-level data science code. Quality software development is a process, and I\\u2019m hoping that data scientists start to adopt thorough processes that allow them to translate their work into deliverable products. Sure it\\u2019s exciting when you develop a new AI that can play computer games better than a human, but it\\u2019s even cooler when your code helps the Empire State Building to save almost a million dollars a year. The field of data science will move past the hype stage of the curve when it proves it can deliver useful products with business value, as software engineering has done for several decades. Data science can have a massive impact on the real world but that won\\u2019t happen until data scientists use practices that allow our code to withstand the rigors of the real world. I write about data science and sometimes other interesting activities. The best place to follow me is on Twitter @koehrsen_will. If you aren\\u2019t using docker for data science, then you probably should be. Docker is best thought of as a light virtual machine that runs images \\u2014 environments \\u2014 containing all the libraries, data, and code for a project. Docker is great for reproducible data science as it makes sharing code much easier: instead of sending code and requirements, you can make a Docker image and your project will just work on anyone else\\u2019s machine when they run your image. This solves the \\u201cdependency hell\\u201d issues that inevitably arise whenever people try to share code: \\u201cit worked on my machine\\u201d is now a phrase of the past thanks to Docker. Even with the clear benefits of Docker, many data scientists still haven\\u2019t embraced the technology. Making a Docker image requires writing a Dockerfilewith the commands to build an image. While this isn\\u2019t difficult, it\\u2019s far easier to just pip freeze > requirements.txt a Python environment and be done with it (not the best practice but better than nothing). Fortunately, thanks to the repo2dockertool from Project Jupyter, the process to create a Docker image from a GitHub repository is now just a single line of code. If that\\u2019s enough for you, then go get started! Otherwise, read on for a few more details. Repo2Docker works by inspecting a GitHub repository for any number of configuration files such as requirements.txt for Python libraries, environment.yml for Conda, or setup.py for building Python packages. It then translates these into a Dockerfile and builds the image. Finally, it runs the image and starts a Jupyter Server where you can access Jupyter Notebooks (or even RStudio). All of this is done in one command! For more info on the details of repo2docker, check out: Intro post, documentation, or the GitHub repository (contributions are always welcome). (repo2docker is also the technology behind binder, another project from Jupyter worth checking out.) The command and eventual output will look like this: Run a notebook and marvel at how easy it was to use docker with repo2docker Once the docker container is running, open a new shell and type docker ps to see the container process. Get the CONTAINER_ID and then run docker exec -it CONTAINER_ID /bin/bash to open an interactive shell in the running container. From the shell, you can do anything you do at the command line such as listing files, running python scripts, or monitoring processes. When you are done with your session, you can shut down the Jupyter server and the container with ctrl + c or docker stop CONTAINER ID. The good news is when we want to restart the container, we don\\u2019t have to re-runrepo2docker repo-link again. The entire environment is saved as a docker image on our machine which we can see with docker image list. To start this container again, select the IMAGE ID and run the command: This will start the container, publish the container\\u2019s port 8888 to the host port 12345, and run a jupyter notebook accessible at 127.0.0.1:12345. You can once again access the Jupyter Notebook in your browser with all the requirements ready to go. (Thanks to this issue on GitHub for providing this solution. Also, see the docs on docker for more options) repo2docker is under continuous work, and there is an active pull request for automatically using a pre-built image if the configuration files in the GitHub repository have not changed. The above command will always work though and can also be used for images not created through repo2docker . Once you learn the basics from repo2docker , try working through some of the Docker guides to see how to effectively make use of Docker. Much as you don\\u2019t have to worry about the details of backpropagation when building a neural network in Keras, you shouldn\\u2019t have to master complex commands to practice reproducible data science. Fortunately, the tools of data science continue to get better, making it easier to adopt best practices and hopefully encouraging more diverse people to enter the field. Repo2docker is one of these technologies that will make you more efficient as a data scientist. Sure, you can be the old grouchy man: \\u201cI spent all that time learning docker and now the young kids can\\u2019t even write a dockerfile\\u201d or you can take the high road and celebrate the ever-increasing layers of abstraction. These layers separate you from the tedious details allowing you to concentrate on the best part of data science: enabling better decisions through data. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will. Apache Spark is one of the most popular technologies on the big data landscape. As a framework for distributed computing, it allows users to scale to massive datasets by running computations in parallel either on a single machine or on clusters of thousands of machines. Spark can be used with Scala, R, Java, SQL, or Python code and its capabilities have led to a rapid adoption as the size of datasets \\u2014 and the need for methods to work with them \\u2014 increase. After using Dask to scale automated feature engineering with Featuretools by running calculations in parallel on a single multi-core machine, we wanted to see if we could use a similar approach with Spark to scale to a cluster of multiple machines. While Dask can also be used for cluster computing, we wanted to demonstrate that Featuretools can run on multiple distributed computing frameworks. The same feature engineering code that runs in parallel using Dask requires no modification to also be distributed with Spark. In this article, we\\u2019ll see how to use Spark with PySpark to run Featuretools on a computing cluster to scale to even larger datasets. The code for this article is available as a Jupyter Notebook on GitHub. The WSDM customer churn dataset consists of several hundred million rows of transactions, listening records, and background information for customers of a subscription music streaming service. The three tables in the dataset come in just over 30 GB total with a prediction problem of trying to determine when customers will churn. The definition of churn can depend on the business use case and this dataset provides good practice for prediction engineering: defining the problem and then creating labels for a supervised machine learning task. This article will stick to the Spark implementation of feature engineering, but stay tuned for future articles on the process of defining and solving a prediction problem. This article will also skip the Featuretools details, but for a guide on how Featuretools is used for automated feature engineering, check out this article or this project comparing manual to automated feature engineering. The details of how Featuretools works are relatively straightforward, but all we need to know is that it makes hundreds of features from a relational dataset. We can use the same approach taken with Dask to scale to a cluster with Spark: partition the data into independent subsets, and then distribute feature engineering with these subsets to multiple workers. This follows the general framework of breaking one large problem up into easier sub-problems, each of which can be run by a single worker. To partition the data, we take the customer id represented as a string and The code is shown below: Using the hashing function ensures that a string will always map to the same integer, so the same customer will always end up in the same partition. The assignment of customers to partition is random, but that is not an issue because each customer is independent of the others. The end result of partitioning is that each partition holds all the data necessary to build a feature matrix for a subset of customers. Each partition is independent of all the others: we can calculate the feature matrix for one partition without worrying about the customers in any other partition. This will allow us to run the feature engineering in parallel since workers do not need to communicate with one another. Using the id_to_hash function, we take our three individual large dataframes \\u2014 representing transactions, user logs, and membership info \\u2014 and convert all of the customer ids to a partition number. To actually partition the data, the most efficient approach is to use a groupby on the partition number and then iteratively save each partition. For example, in the members dataframe where the msno column is the customer id, then the following code partitions the dataframe into 1000 separate files and saves them. Wrapping this code in a function, we can then partition all of the dataframes. If we have a large file that cannot fit into memory, such as the user_logs, then we can read and partition it in chunks using pandas pd.read_csv. Working with a 30 GB file, this code ran in about 3 minutes. Partitioning data is a common approach when working with large datasets. All of the partitions are stored in Amazon S3 so they can be accessible to all machines in the Spark cluster. Since this implementation used Amazon EC2 instances, storing the data in Amazon\\u2019s cloud makes for efficient read and write operations. The data in S3 is persistent, meaning that it will always be accessible even when we shut down the EC2 instances. The data on the instances, in contrast, are ephemeral which means they don\\u2019t maintain state. Storing data in S3 means that it can be accessed it from anywhere \\u2014 EC2 instances or local machines\\u2014 and we can shut down the EC2 instances when not in use without worrying about loss of data. Reading and writing can be done directly to S3 using nearly the same syntax as local input / output and if our servers and data are located in the same region, is fairly quick. The distributed architecture is made up of the following parts: Once all the data is partitioned and uploaded to Amazon S3, we need to launch a Spark cluster that will carry out the feature engineering. For the cluster, we choose EC2 instances because of the speed and ease of launching multiple machines. This project only used 3 instances, but the same approach could scale to thousands of machines. Setting up a Spark cluster can be tough. I recommend following this guide to get up and running. For demonstration purposes, I used a relatively small cluster consisting of one parent node and two worker nodes. (Following the lead of Guido van Rossum and the Python community, I am using the terms parent and worker in place of the outdated master and slave.) Once the instances are running, they can be connected by launching Spark from the parent and then connecting the workers. If everything goes correctly, you can monitor the cluster from localhost:8080 on the parent machine: Getting a cluster running is the hardest point, and from here, the code to distribute the computation across all workers is straightforward. Moreover, I was able to run all the code from a Jupyter Notebook, my preferred working environment. It\\u2019s pretty neat that a Jupyter Notebook that runs on a single machine can be used to distribute calculations across thousands of machines! (I followed this guide to work with Spark in Jupyter). The first thing to do in the Jupyter Notebook is initialize Spark . For this we use the findspark Python library, passing in the location of the Spark installation on the parent machine. Then, we need to create a SparkContext , the entry point to a Spark application. This sets up the internal services and creates a connection to a Spark execution environment. There are a number of parameters to pass to the SparkContext and we can also use a SparkConf object to specify a certain configuration. The below code creates both a SparkConf and a SparkContext with parameters based on my set up: The number of executors, 3, is set equal to the number of instances, with each executor having access to 4 cores and a maximum of 12 GB of memory. Total, we have 12 workers, each of which can carry out one feature matrix calculation for a partition at a time. The master is the IP address of your spark cluster which can be found at the local dashboard on the parent\\u2019s port 8080. These values were set based on trial and error and this guide. The function that we want to distribute works as follows: The pseudo-code for the function is below: The tasks we want to parallelize in this function are just a list of partitions: The final step is to distribute the computation. We tell Spark to take the partitions and divide them between our workers. We then map tasks to the function by sending each partition number to partition_to_feature_matrix. Using our SparkContext , we can do this in a single (long) line. While the calculations are running, we can monitor progress both on the Spark parent dashboard at localhost:8080 and the specific job dashboard at localhost:4040. The job dashboard gives us quite a lot of information starting with a basic overview: The stages tab shows us the directed acyclic graph, which in this case is not very complicated since all of the partitions are a single step run independently. Here we can also see more detailed information as the jobs complete such as summary statistics of the time to run each task. (The job dashboard is only available when the computation is ongoing so wait until you\\u2019ve submitted a task before trying to pull it up.) After a few hours, the computation has finished and the feature matrices \\u2014 with 230 features for each customer \\u2014 are stored in S3. At this point, we can join the feature matrices together for modeling, or, if we have a model that supports incremental learning, we can train on one partition at a time. Breaking one large problem up into many smaller problems is a common design pattern when working with massive datasets. Apache Spark is a powerful framework for distributed computing that lets us scale to hundreds of machines and as much data as we can get our hands on. In this article, we saw how an automated feature engineering workflow in Featuretools could scale to a large dataset using a compute cluster managed by Spark. We were able to take the same Featuretools code that runs on a single machine and run it on multiple machines using minimal PySpark code. Although this approach used Pandas dataframes, it\\u2019s also possible to write code in PySpark using Spark dataframes for increased efficiency in the Spark ecosystem. We\\u2019ll have more updates on this in the future, but for now, we know how to use the partition and distribute approach to efficiently parallelize feature engineering with Spark. If like me, you got your start blogging on Medium, but also want to build your own website to display your articles, you\\u2019ll need a way to move articles from Medium to the Markdown language. Markdown is a lightweight language meant to be converted into HTML for the web, and there are several tools that allow you to go from existing Medium articles to Markdown for a blog. (If you don\\u2019t yet have a blog, then follow this guide to build your own website in five minutes using Jekyll and GitHub pages.) There is both a Chrome Extension and a command line tool for taking your Medium posts to Markdown. Unfortunately, I\\u2019ve found the Chrome Extension to be unreliable, and if it does work, it makes a number of formatting errors that require correcting. If you can get the chrome extension to work and you aren\\u2019t comfortable at the command line, then that is probably the best choice for you. However, I\\u2019ve found the command line tool to be better for my use because it works every time, and requires fewer re-adjustments to the text after running. The medium-to-markdown command line package is written in Javascript which means you\\u2019ll need node to run and npm to install the package. If you\\u2019re on Windows, use this page to install both (it takes about 3 minutes). Then, install the package using npm install medium-to-markdown. The actual script you\\u2019ll need to run is available here, and also shown below. To run, save the script as medium-to-markdown.js, change the \\\"<medium post url\\\"> to the address of your published post, and type node medium-to-markdown.js at the command line (making sure the script is in your directory. This will output the entire post as Markdown in your console. To redirect the output to a file, you can type node medium-to-markdown.js >> file.md If you\\u2019re using GitHub Pages + Jekyll for your blog, you\\u2019ll want to save the md file in the _posts/ directory of your repository as date-title.md . For example, my latest post file is _posts/2018-09-16-Five-Minutes-to-Your-Own-Website.md . Once the article has been converted to a properly named Markdown file, it can be published by pushing the repository to GitHub. Personally, I found that process of manually renaming the file tedious, so I wrote a Python script that accepts a url of a published Medium post along a date, calls the medium-to-markdown.js conversion script with the url, and saves the resulting markdown with the correct file name. The script can be found here, and the command line usage is below: Overall, it takes 15 seconds to run the script and about 5 minutes for the website to update! Go to your blog to see the article rendered. Both the Chrome Extension and Command line tool create minor issues in the Markdown that you\\u2019ll have to fix. I do all my editing in the Prose online editor and like to pull up the editor and the original Medium article side-by-side.(I also frequently use the Chrome development tools \\u2014 right click and inspect \\u2014 on my blog to adjust the css and see the changes immediately. ) Following are a few of the issues I\\u2019ve noticed and how to fix them. I\\u2019ll assume you\\u2019re working with GitHub Pages and Jekyll for your blog (follow this guide to get started) although these tips may work with other frameworks. These solutions are not exhaustive, so if you run into any more problems, let me know in the comments or on Twitter. As you can see above, the default conversion to Markdown renders image captions left-justified below the image. To center the captions, add the following to your styles.scss file (in the repository root directory): Then, in the Markdown itself, change the caption text from the default shown on top to the bottom. Make sure the caption is on a separate line: The caption will now be centered below the image. If you don\\u2019t like this styling, change the css listed above. To render images side by side in markdown, you can use a two-column table. I\\u2019ve found that you have to include the headers or the table does not show correctly. There are a couple other options, but the table works well. Here\\u2019s the blank code for a table so just replace the image_link and header: If you write a lot about programming, then you want your code to look great! Fortunately, unlike on Medium, you can use syntax highlighting to make your code blocks pop out on your blog. Jekyll natively supports the rouge language highlighter which has numerous styles to choose between (view them here). In the Markdown for the article, surround code blocks using backticks and specify the language for highlighting: The default syntax highlighting looks like this: Using a custom defined theme, the highlighting comes out like so: To set your own code theme, refer to this article, or if you like the look of mine, you can copy and paste my code style sheet code-highlighting.scss (link) into your _sass/ directory. Then change the line in style.scss that reads @import \\u201chighlights\\u201d to @import \\u201ccode-highlighting\\\" (this should be near the bottom) to import the new style instead. Another common part of my Medium posts are GitHub gists. To properly show these in your posts, start by going to the original medium article, right click on the Gist, and select inspect frame . This will bring up a page of what looks like incomprehensible code. However, all you need to do is copy what\\u2019s between the <script> tags as below: Simply copy and paste this line into the Markdown as shown below and it will be properly rendered on your blog. Of course, like any other element on your website, you can style the block using css however you like! By default, Jekyll will only show the first paragraph of your post on the main page of your blog with a button showing Read More to access the rest. If you have a picture at the top of your post, this is all that will be displayed. To extend the excerpt, add the following line to _config.yaml: Then put the <!--more--> tag in the post markdown wherever you want the excerpt to end. There are still numerous options I haven\\u2019t explored. If you want to do something on your blog, chances are there\\u2019s a way to get it done. For example, you can add comments to all of your posts by making a Disqus account and adding it to your _config.yaml file (guide here). If you have a lot of posts and want to limit the number that appear on one page, you can specify that as well using pagination in the config file (instructions). Building a website is exciting because you are able to make it look however you want! Although this might not seem amazing to most people, I still appreciate when I make a minor update to my site and I can see the changes online just as I intended. You can\\u2019t imagine how enthusiastic I was when I finally got a live code editor running on my about page! At the end of the day, yes, building a website is about putting yourself out there for the world to see, but it\\u2019s also about taking pride in something you created. Going from an existing Medium article to Markdown can be done quickly using a command line tool. There are a few minor errors that need to be addressed after converting to Markdown, but this also gives you the chance to customize the post exactly how you want. If you are still stuck on any points, take a look through my website repository to see if you can find a solution there, or get in contact with me. Moreover, if you find something cool that you can do with a Jekyll blog, I\\u2019d enjoy hearing about it. Now get out there and start writing. As always, I welcome comments and constructive criticism. I can be reached on Twitter @koehrsen_will or through my website willk.online Technology should improve real life not replace it Lately, I have noticed a disturbing phenomenon. I unlock my phone to complete a basic task \\u2014 say check my calendar \\u2014 notice that I have a social media or email notification, and without even thinking or really wanting to, click on the notification. The next few minutes I\\u2019ll spend mindlessly scrolling through tweets that only frustrate me or reading irrelevant emails. Eventually, with considerable effort, I\\u2019ll pull my gaze away from my phone and bring myself back into the real world. Five minutes later, I\\u2019ll realize I never did the task I unlocked my phone for in the first place. As a graduate student working in a data science lab, I used to pride myself on how long I could stare at a screen every day. Working as long as possible is almost a competition among the students, and anyone leaving early or unplugging from their computers is looked down upon. However, as events like the one described above became more common, I started to take a critical examination of the role of tech in my life. What does looking at a screen for 12 hours a day do to me and my attention, and is it really something that I want to spend the rest of my life doing? Eventually, I decided I needed to take a more balanced approach to my technology use. Inspired by the principle of the slow movement, which aims to experience life more fully by slowing down the hectic pace of modernity, I drew up the following set of guidelines for a new relationship with technology. My goal is to restore the original purpose of technology: improve and simplify real life rather than replace it. Expecting perfection is a good way to fail to stick to your resolutions, and I don\\u2019t always expect to uphold these guidelines. This will be a gradual shift rather than an overnight fix to establish a healthy relationship with technology. Moreover, this is not an anti-tech stance or about abandoning technology, but about realizing it is a tool, and as with any other tool, can be used for both good and bad. As a data scientist, I try to be skeptical about data and I need to also start thinking critically about the expanding role of technology in my life. By adopting a slow-tech attitude, we can continue to take advantage of the benefits of tech while regaining control of our attention. As always, I welcome feedback, discussion, and constructive criticism. A review of The Black Swan: The Impact of the Highly Improbable Why is is that we would be shocked to find someone 55 feet tall, but we routinely hear of people making $5.6 million a year or more and think nothing of it? The former represents an individual only 10 times the average height, while the latter has a salary 100 times the average household income in the US. As Nassim Taleb explains in The Black Swan, these two quantities comes from fundamentally different realms. The first is generated by the natural world, what Taleb refers to as Mediocristan, while the second is a product of the recent technological world created by humans, Extremistan. For nearly all of human history, we have occupied Mediocristan, where quantities are normally distributed with few values far from the average and no extreme values. Almost all phenomenon in nature behave in this manner: there are no animals that live for 10,000 years, no trees miles tall, and no humans that can run 100 miles per hour. It is only in the past century as a result of science and technological advances that we have constructed Extremistan, where outlying values such as Bill Gates\\u2019 net worth of $80 billion (about 300,000 times the average American net worth) or books sales of 500 million (the first Harry Potter) are entirely possible. These professions, computer software and creative fields, are examples of jobs that are infinitely scalable, that is, the amount of gain added does not scale linearly with the amount of effort put in. If J.K. Rowling writes a successful book that sells 10,000 copies, she does not have to put in 10 times as much effort to write a book that sells 100,000 copies. She can add another zero to the total sales with a minimal amount of effort. In contrast, traditional professions, such as baking scale linearly. In order for a baker to sell another loaf of bread, he has to bake another loaf and 10 times more sales means making 10 times as many loaves. As Taleb points out, if you want to become very wealthy, choose an infinitely scalable profession rather than a linearly scaling one where you are paid in direct proportion to the amount of hours worked. Evolution has not prepared us for quantities which can take on such a vast array of values. We are therefore ill-equipped to handle or even process events far out of the ordinary. The 777 point drop in the stock market on September 9, 2008 sent the entire world into a panic because we were used to seeing moves on the order of a few points up or down in a day. Finance, Taleb\\u2019s area of expertise, is one of the best examples of a field that lives in Extremistan. The wealth of individuals, the GDP of nations, and the value of stocks are all values that differ by numerous orders of magnitude, unlike most quantities in the natural world. There is simply no way to comprehend how three individuals (Gates, Warren Buffet, and Jeff Bezos) are worth more than the bottom 50% of Americans combined. The massive range of possible values for these quantities mean they can change by an unthinkable amount in a few hours, leaving us totally unprepared for the consequences. Finance is not the only modern pursuit to create extreme swings. Science and technology have created many values that are not normally distributed. Book sales, social media followers, search engine users, and battle deaths all tend to have a few outliers that vastly exceed the other examples combined. The World Wars were so terrible because the destruction dwarfed that of any previous conflict. We do not prepare for these events because they are simply out of our consideration, which served us well for 99% of human history, but now does not know how to handle numbers outside of \\u201creasonable\\u201d ranges. \\u201cBlack Swan\\u201d refers to the theory that residents of Europe only believed that white swans existed until they encountered black swans in Australia. The Europeans, like most of us today, suffered from what is known as confirmation bias. Rather than seek out examples that would have disproved their white swan theory, such as a single black swan, they kept seeing only white swans which further entrenched their (false) belief. We do this often, especially in politics where we tend to follow only news sources that confirm our biases and ignore evidence that goes against our personal beliefs. However, in order to prepare for Black Swan events, we should look for disconfirmatory evidence, observations that disprove our theories. It only takes a single counterexample, like the stock market crash of 1929 to show our theory about the rationality of markets is incorrect. By seeking only confirmation, we blind ourselves to the possibility that our ideas may be wrong, often with disastrous results. When a black swan does occur we try to rationalize it after the fact, a process known as hindsight bias. As humans, we like to believe the world obeys certain rules, and for the most part this served us well in our carefree days in Mediocristan. However, by justifying past events with a well-told narrative, we downplay the chance of future extreme events and therefore do not take them into consideration when planning our daily lives. While it would be foolish to take this idea too far and live constantly in fear of an event we cannot see coming we should be more open to the concept that rare phenomenon actually occur all the time, particularly in the recent fields of finance, science, and technology. How can we deal with events that we don\\u2019t see coming and are outside of our realm of experience? Well, first we should give up trying to predict black swans because, as Taleb states, while we think that intelligent individuals make accurate predictions, it is in fact the smartest people who admit their uncertainty about the future. Instead of making uncertain forecasts, we can build up our robustness. For banks, that might mean maintaining more low-risk bonds than high risk stocks on the chance that the market takes a turn for the worse. On a personal level, we should try to learn from our small failures in order to avoid potentially larger ones down the road. We can learn the perils of playing the daily stock market from investing a few hundred dollars in penny stocks and avoid the larger mistake of losing all of our retirement savings. Taleb has outlined 10 principles to build resilience against Black Swans which includes holding individuals and institutions responsible for past mistakes, and making systems as simple as possible so they can be easily monitored for problems. It is imprudent to attempt to predict specific Black Swans, but if we prepare for the possibility of any Black Swan, then we will be better equipped to deal with the consequences. As always, I judge a book by whether or not I can get the whole picture from a five-minute summary or if I need to read the entire book. In the case of the Black Swan, I would not recommend reading all of the book. Taleb covers a lot of interesting concepts, such as human biases, but they are not topics unique to his writing. He does provide a few personal anecdotes which help to reinforce the ideas but he also constructs several fake narratives to illustrate his points which I found distracting. If you want to learn about biases, I recommend Thinking, Fast and Slow by Daniel Kahnemann (or any of his research papers written with Amos Tversky). There are a number of good web pages on the general Black Swan theory and the basic idea can be wrapped up in one sentence: rare events happen more than we think they will, and while we cannot predict them precisely in advance, we can construct our society to be more resilient to surprises. It\\u2019s a valuable concept, and if we want to enjoy the benefits of science, technology, and finance, then we must reckon with their unique tradeoffs for which our natural history has not prepared us.

A Simple Step to Regain (some) of Your Digital Autonomy For most of us, the story of our relationship with Google is one in which we have willingly ceded to Google ever more control of our digital lives. While this has resulted in great product recommendations and personalized search results, we have to wonder when it becomes too much. Fortunately, there are a number of steps you can take to stem the loss of digital autonomy. One of the simplest actions is learning how to take control of your location in Google Chrome. Manually Set Location Using Developer Tools Using Google Chrome\\u2019s developer tools, you can easily set your location to any latitude and longitude coordinates. To access the developer tools in the console, press Control+Shift+I (Command+Option+J on Mac) or right-click on any web page and select inspect. Next, click the three vertical dots in the upper right of the developer tools panel (when you hover over the dots you should see \\u201cCustomize and Control DevTools\\u201d). Find the \\u201cMore Tools\\u201d entry, and click to expand the options. Select the \\u201cSensors\\u201d option as shown. This will display the sensors tab in the bottom half of the developer tools panel. The first category under sensors is geolocation which will be set to \\u201cNo override.\\u201d Expand the options and choose either a custom latitude and longitude set of coordinates or a preset location to change the physical location reported by your browser. An easy way to find latitude and longitude coordinates is to open Google Maps and click on any location. The latitude and longitude of the center of your screen will appear in the address bar. Testing it Out Let\\u2019s see how this well this works. Say we are looking for housing options in a new city. If I do a simple Google search for housing, Google will filter my search results based on my location. Google gets your location from your IP address, location history, or recent search history, which can be great when you want location-relevant results, but frustrating if you want to see results for other locations. Luckily, now we can set our location to anywhere and compare the results. I\\u2019ll choose Shanghai and see what comes up. After setting my location to Shanghai, Google has decided to show me a map of Shanghai with potential locations of interest, but the websites listed are all for housing in New York. Perhaps this is because Google has figured out that people in Shanghai often look for housing in New York? I can\\u2019t claim to know how the search algorithm works, but it is clearly dependent on where Chrome thinks you are. This modification can be used on any website that asks for your location, such as weather sites. Using the developer tools to manually set location is a very limited method. You must set your location on any new tab you open, and this change will not persist after you close the developer tools. However, there are a number of better solutions. Disable Website Locations If you do not want any websites to be able to access or even ask for your location, open the Google Chrome settings by clicking the three vertical dots at the upper right of Chrome ( when you hover over them you should see \\u201cCustomize and control Google Chrome\\u201d ). Click on settings which will open the Chrome settings in another tab. Scroll down to advanced and click to expand the advanced settings. Under Privacy and security click on \\u201cContent settings\\u201d to control the information websites can access. Find and click on the option called location. By default, Google Chrome will set this to \\u201cAsk before accessing\\u201d which is why you will often receive a pop-up box when arriving at a website asking if you want to allow or block the site from using your location. In order to not see this box again, click on location and then click on the blue slider which should change it to grey as shown below. If you see this screen, then congratulations, you have blocked all websites from accessing your location. However, Google can and will still know your location and can filter search results accordingly. From this location page, you can also manually designate the sites that have access to your location and those that are blocked. The websites that are allowed and blocked are those that you have either allowed or blocked respectively when asked by your browser in the past. If there is a website that you clicked \\u201callow\\u201d but now no longer want to access your location, you can remove it from the allow list. Likewise you can do the same to websites you may have accidentally blocked. Virtual Private Networks For a more persistent method of altering your location, consider using a Virtual Private Network (VPN). These services route your computer\\u2019s traffic through servers that can be located in any country. Therefore, your IP address will be reported as that of the server, and you can typically choose the location of the server (if you pay for a decent VPN). VPNs are a necessity if you are doing any secure work on public networks and are a great way to access content that may be blocked in your particular geographic region (if for example you happen to live under an oppressive regime). As long as you are connected to the VPN, your traffic will appear to be coming from the server\\u2019s IP address and neither Google nor any website will be able to determine your true location. I recommend doing some research and paying a small yearly fee (about $5) for a legitimate VPN. They provide an extra layer of security and anonymity especially in public locations where most users typically do not take any precautions. Conclusion You now have a simple way to temporarily make Google or any website think you are somewhere else, or to obscure your location permanently if you choose to use a VPN. This is only a tiny step, but it is a step in the right direction of maintaining both your anonymity and security. Digital literacy is as important in the 21st century as print literacy was in the 20th, and this one action can be the start of regaining control of your digital experiences. If you would like to know more ways to keep yourself safe and/or anonymous online, I recommend Kevin Mitnick\\u2019s book The Art of Invisibility. Mitnick is a former criminal hacker who now works for the good guys and his book outlines practical advice for digital safety and privacy. A review of Radical Technologies by Adam Greenfield One Sentence Summary: Current and near-future technologies offer great potential for enhancing our lives, but we need to consider the inherent trade-offs in adopting products and services that dictate an increasing portion of our everyday experiences. \\u201cWe live in a society exquisitely dependent on science and technology, in which hardly anyone knows anything about science and technology\\u201d- Carl Sagan In the nearly three decades since Carl Sagan voiced his concern, we have adopted an amazing array of technologies into our daily lives \\u2014 smartphones, laptops, the World Wide Web, digital maps, Siri, Alexa, Facebook, the Internet of Things \\u2014 which have increased convenience and expanded our connectivity with other individuals around the world. Yet, we still do not grasp the fundamentals behind these technologies or realize what we sacrifice when we adopt them without a moment\\u2019s hesitation. We imagine technology as a beneficial force with only positive effects \\u2014 greater ease and access to information \\u2014 while we overlook the trade-offs \\u2014 decreased privacy and autonomy \\u2014 implicit in upgrading to the latest model. Advances promised to us in the coming decades \\u2014 augmented reality, 3D printing, machine learning, cryptocurrency \\u2014 are designed to satisfy our needs and bring us novel forms of entertainment. Before we blindly accept these products and services, it is critical that we understand the implications of relinquishing ever more control of our day-to-day experiences to the companies that provide them. This argument forms the premise for Adam Greenfield\\u2019s Radical Technologies: The Design of Everyday Life, which explains not only how modern and near-future technologies work, but the concessions we make when these developments are woven into the fabric of modern life. Ceding Control The modern smartphone has become our constant companion \\u2014 you probably spend more time with your phone than with any individual \\u2014 and the tools it offers us are indispensable to many of our daily routines. What we see in our smartphones is a sleek exterior housing and a 4.7 inch screen radiating crystal clear images of anything that we desire. What we experience with our devices is an ability to communicate with anyone in the world at a moment\\u2019s notice, or to navigate in an unfamiliar city and receive recommendations tailored to our interests. What we fail to observe is the $250 worth of precious metals and raw materials making up our phones that are extracted at an enormous environmental cost, or the $4 in labor required to assemble the phone in Shenzhen, a city of 18 million in China where 90% of the world\\u2019s electronics will pass through at some point in the manufacturing process. Also escaping our purview is the immense amount of data we generate in the process of every action involving our phones. When we receive directions from Google Maps, we don\\u2019t stop to consider how incredible it is that Google can provide us with real time maps of the entire world at no cost. In reality, Google has become one of the most valuable and influential companies in history through the accumulation of data, and every service they offer is provided not for free, but in exchange for access to the information our daily activities generate. When we stop at a store or drive faster than the speed limit while using Maps, Google records that information and can then sell it to advertisers or auto insurance companies that might be interested in your driving habits. Greenfield refers to this as the monetization of everyday experience. After companies realized they could extract valuable information from the activities we do on a regular basis, they developed seemingly free platforms to entice us to share more information. Facebook does not exist because it believes in the ultimate good of allowing humans to connect with one another, it exists because there are billions of dollars to be made from capturing our social interactions, our likes, and our interests. We are happy to exchange vast quantities of data about our personal preferences for a curated news feed with content that Facebook knows will keep us coming back day after day. Facebook, Google (now under Alphabet), Amazon, and Apple are becoming more than companies that offer us services and devices. By creating ecosystems that control ever more parts of our lives, they want to become decision-makers for the majority of our daily choices while gathering vast amounts of information in the process. Greenfield refers to these ecosystems as \\u201cStacks,\\u201d or institutions that want to make themselves into the sole providers of services/products in a domain. The most efficient way to accomplish these aims is through the aggregation of user data which allows the stacks to provide you with better personal recommendations and sell that information to other companies. When we log into our social networks, we see precisely the kinds of things that Facebook has identified interest us based on our past tendencies. From too many personal experiences, I know the incredible effectiveness of Amazon product offerings, and if you are still unwise enough to use the web without an ad-blocker, you might have noticed ads for a product you researched on Amazon minutes before. In effect, both of these companies have become information filters. We give them access to our history, and they sort through the mounds of products and news stories and show us only what they have learned we want to see. To some degree this is a necessity; the amount of information in the modern age is overwhelming, and without a means to sift through it, we can waste time on irrelevant content. Yet, what are we missing in the news stories we never see or the search results that Google does not show us? The extreme polarization in modern politics is at least partly because the pre-filtering of content has made it possible for us to read only the information that supports our views. If you rely on Facebook as your sole source of news, you can go the rest of your life without seeing a contrary opinion. It might be nice to wake up on a Sunday morning and read stories that confirm your pre-existing beliefs, but this results in an inaccurate conception of human life that misses all of our nuances and conflicting opinions. Furthermore, society progresses not when individuals gather in echo chambers, but when all sides of an argument are allowed to intermingle and to discuss the issue. The only place these debates might occur for most of us is online, but they have no chance to occur when we artificially limit the diversity of information to which we are exposed. In effect, we have created is a system in which we are censored by our own likes and search history, which has real-world consequences for the political functioning of our country. Not only do the stacks determine the news we read and the search results we see, but over the past few years we have gradually off-loaded more and more decisions to their algorithms (an algorithm is a system that takes in some information and executes a set of instructions based on that information to produce an output). These algorithms have become astonishingly accurate thanks to the maturation of machine learning. The capability of machine learning algorithms is directly proportional to the amount of data they have access to because these models are \\u201ctrained\\u201d on past data. For example, the Amazon product recommendation software is a machine learning algorithm that has learned from the shopping history of millions of users for almost two decades. Anytime you are logged in to your Amazon account, the algorithm compares your shopping and search history to all other users and recommends the products you are most likely to be interested in based on what other users with similar profiles have purchased. As you provide more information to the system, it gets better at predicting what you want. According to a recent study, with just 150 likes, Facebook knows your preferences better than close family members, and, with 300 likes, Facebook can predict your choices better than your spouse. This incredible ability to forecast our future behavior means we no longer need to make conscious consumer decisions. The music we listen to, the products we buy, the movies we watch, the route we take to work, the restaurants where we eat, and even the people we date are now routinely selected not by sentient humans, but by machine learning systems that might know us better than we know ourselves. What we gain in convenience we lose in autonomy, or the ability to make our own choices. Moreover, for now, these algorithms are still developed by humans and they reflect the biases of their creators. In 2017, those developers were overwhelmingly white, male, 20-somethings, living in a particular region of California. With each passing year, we pass more and more decisions to this small group of individuals employed by the Stacks. Engineering Our Downfall In addition to recommending us the perfect restaurant to try or the optimal route to take home, machine learning algorithms are rapidly developing the ability to perform tasks previously accomplished only by humans. Nearly every job held by humans today is based on patterns and algorithms: we encounter a situation, respond to it via a set of learned rules, and produce useful output as a result. Even the job of a doctor is an algorithm: they ask a patient a series of questions, check the patient\\u2019s medical history and symptoms, and then generate a treatment plan based on a set of established guidelines. There are nuances between the interpretation of a patient\\u2019s condition, but the overall process is always the same. Creative endeavors such as writing and music composition come down to recognizing and recreating the patterns humans find most enjoyable. Machine learning algorithms excel at pattern recognition and hence have conquered many human domains. Machine learning systems can now diagnose MRI scans more accurately than doctors, navigate city streets better than human drivers, and compose music that is indistinguishable from that of the best biological composer. Past threats of machines taking human jobs went unfulfilled because humans found a way to stay a step ahead. When agriculture was mechanized, we taught ourselves to operate machinery in factories. When robots that never needed to rest or lost concentration pushed us out of industry, we went to college and contributed to the service economy. However, the new machine intelligence leaves no room for humans to outsmart or outwork mechanical systems. A recent study concludes that 47% of jobs in America are vulnerable to automation within the next ten years. Humans could be at real risk for becoming economically irrelevant and current government systems are too slow to deal with this potential future. The only institutions with the ability to rapidly adapt are the stacks themselves, and they are the ones who most stand to gain from the adoption of machine intelligence. Even though we may literally be engineering our own irrelevance, it is inconceivable that research into machine intelligence will cease or even slow. Humans have an insatiable desire for progress, even when that progress comes with a demonstrable risk. Researchers are working to develop artificial intelligence, which can be thought of as conscious machine learning algorithms with their own motivations and values. An artificial intelligence that could create its successor would likely be the last invention humanity would ever need to make. Even without any malicious intent, AI could cause the end of humanity. In our quest to transform the world to our liking, we have caused the extinction of numerous species not out of harmful intent, but because we think that our objectives are more important than the survival of a lesser species. Who is to say that an AI would not feel the same way towards us? Although achieving AI could result in the eclipse of humanity, researchers will never give up the dream because of the difficulty of the challenge and the human nature to continue forging ahead into the unknown. This drive has resulted in all of the wonders we enjoy today and the current golden age of civilization, but it also poses an existential risk. While this may seem like science fiction and AI has been \\u201ctwo decades away\\u201d for 50 years, it is important that we discuss the implications of our increasing trust in algorithms and recognize that every decision we give up brings us a step closer to a world with no need for humans. Political discourse is rightly dominated by everyday concerns, but it also needs to encompass long-term planning that accounts for current scientific research. Rather than a reactive government, we need a rule-making body that can anticipate future needs and draft legislation in anticipation for the world of decades from now. Technologies of the Future Radical Technologies is not a pessimistic work. As an advocate for human-centered technology design, Adam Greenfield is best described as a techno-skeptic, and his book is a balanced assessment of new advances compared to the unbridled optimism emanating from Silicon Valley. Therefore, when Greenfield places his approval behind a new technology, his words carry more weight than an author who praises every new phone model. Foremost among the technologies that Greenfield believes will have a positive effect on society in the coming decades are 3D printing and cryptocurrency. News coverage of both of these subjects tends towards extreme praise (\\u201c3D printing will change the world by allowing everyone to be their own manufacturer\\u201d) or gloom (\\u201ccryptocurrency will enable criminals to conduct transactions with no traces\\u201d) which underscores the mundane but steady progress in both fields. 3D-printing, also known as additive manufacturing and embodied by companies such as MakerBot, could distribute ownership of the means of production, but it has so far failed because of high system costs and the availability of cheap products produced overseas. Why buy your own additive manufacturing system and filament to make a chair when you can simply go on Amazon and have any one of thousands delivered to your house in 2 days for under $100? The real people who could benefit from 3D-printing are exactly those who currently lack access to the technology, such as people living in developing countries where the global supply chain extracts from rather than benefits the poor. Additive manufacturing could create a sustainable circular economy, where once a product has reached the end of its useful life, it is simply melted down into material used to create another product. However, as long as the technology remains solely in the hands of mostly upper-class western individuals, it will not profoundly change the world. 3D-printing will be most useful not where it is an expensive hobby for tinkerers, but where it can create necessities of daily life by harvesting waste streams and open-source designs. Cryptocurrency, the most notable example of which is Bitcoin, is another development with great unrealized promise. Greenfield points out that both 3D-printing and cryptocurrency are brilliant concepts that have failed at the interface between the technology and the real world. Digital currencies are designed to enable greater freedom of transactions because they do not have to go through a central clearinghouse. Bitcoin records information on the Blockchain, a global record of all transactions conducted in the currency that is available for download by anyone with an Internet connection. The verification and recording of a transaction is not conducted by a single entity, but by every computer on the network. This means that theoretically, Bitcoin is both less susceptible to price fluctuations than traditional currencies because it is not pegged to a physical entity, and it is not as vulnerable to fraud because faking a transaction would essentially require fooling every single computer verifying the transaction. In the real world, Bitcoin has failed because it does not fulfill the basic function of a currency: it cannot be easily spent. Anyone willing to purchase and spend Bitcoin must first find a broker who exchanges American dollars for Bitcoin, obtain a wallet that can store the currency, and then find a vendor willing to accept the currency in exchange for a product. In an age with one-click checkout, this will never be a feasible option for the majority of consumers who value convenience over privacy. Bitcoin will ultimately be unsuccessful because of difficulty of use (and technical details such as the energy cost ) but the idea of a Blockchain will live on in other currencies and distributed autonomous organizations. When trust in government is eroding (whether or not that is justified), the idea of distributing responsibility to all users of a system could be invaluable to operations such as organizing protests or creating a smarter energy grid. Recommendation The future is shaped not by those who merely know a technology works, but by committed groups of individuals who understand the societal implications of new advances. Knowing how technology functions is important, but knowing how it is used is more critical. Radical Technologies examines both the fundamental building blocks of current and near-future developments and the potential ways in which they may impact society. This book is a worthwhile read in its entirety because it forces us to consider the concessions we make when we allow ever more devices and products to control our daily lives. Once we are aware of the extent to which our existence is dictated by algorithms, it is not difficult to find ways to gain back a little control. You can start by disabling notifications on your phone or choosing only select times to receive alerts to reclaim your time and attention. Next, stop self-censoring yourself and read a different news source or follow entities you might not agree with in order to at least understand their argument. Finally, be skeptical when making any consumer decision.

Nevertheless, the question that we must ask with regards to any advance is how can it be incorporated into our lives without concentrating power in the hands of those select few who understand the technology?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It\\u2019s a machine learning education disguised as a competition! Although there are valid criticisms of Kaggle, overall, it\\u2019s a great community that provides interesting problems, thousands of data scientists willing to share their knowledge, and an ideal environment for exploring new ideas. As evidence of this, I never would have learned about the Gradient Boosting Machine, or, one of the topics of this article, automated model optimization, were it not for the Kaggle Home Credit contest. In this article, part three of a series (Part One: Getting Started and Part Two: Improving) documenting my work for this contest, we will focus on a crucial aspect of the machine learning pipeline: model optimization through hyperparameter tuning. In the second article, we decided on the Gradient Boosting Machine as our model of choice, and now we have to get the most out of it through optimization. We\\u2019ll do this primarily with two methods: random search and automated tuning with Bayesian optimization. All the work presented here is available to run on Kaggle in the following notebooks. The article itself will highlight the key ideas but the code details are all in the notebooks (which are free to run with nothing to install!) For this article we will skip the background, so if at any time you feel lost, I encourage you to go to the previous articles and notebooks. All of the notebooks can be run on Kaggle without the need to download anything, so I highly recommend checking them out or competing! In the first part of this series, we got familiar with the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, tried our hand at feature engineering, and built a few baseline models. Our public leaderboard score from this round was 0.678 (which at the moment would place us lower than 4000 on the leaderboard). Part two involved in-depth manual feature engineering, followed by feature selection and more modeling. Using the expanded (and then contracted) set of features, we ended up with a score of 0.779, quite an improvement from the baseline, but not quite in the top 50% of competitors. In this article, we will once again better our score and move up 1000 places on the leaderboard. Optimization in the context of machine learning means finding the set of model hyperparameter values that yield the highest cross validation score for a given dataset. Model hyperparameters, in contrast to model parameters that are learned during training, are set by the data scientist before training. The number of layers in a deep neural network is a model hyperparameter while the splits in a decision tree are model parameters. I like to think of model hyperparameters as settings that we need to tune for a dataset: the ideal combination of values is different for every problem! There are a handful of ways to tune a machine learning model: These are presented in order of increasing efficiency, with manual search taking the most time (and often yielding the poorest results) and automated methods converging on the best values the quickest, although, as with many topics in machine learning, this is not always the case! As shown in this great paper, random search does surprisingly well (which we\\u2019ll see shortly). (There are also other hyperparameter tuning methods such as evolutionary and gradient-based. There are constantly better methods being developed, so make sure to stay up to date on the current best practice!) In the second part of this series, we decided to use the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model because of its superior performance on structured data with many features. The GBM is extremely powerful (yet easy to implement in Python), but it has dozens of hyperparameters that significantly affect performance and which must be optimized for a problem. If you want to feel overwhelmed, check out the documentation on the LightGBM library: I don\\u2019t think there is anyone in the world who can look at all of these and pick the best values! Therefore, we need to implement one of the four methods for choosing the hyperparameters. For this problem, I didn\\u2019t even try manual tuning, both because this was my first time working with the GBM and because I didn\\u2019t want to waste any time. e\\u2019ll skip straight to random search and automated techniques using Bayesian optimization. In the first notebook, we go through an implementation of grid and random search covering the four parts of an optimization problem: These four parts also form the basis of Bayesian optimization, so laying them out here will help when it comes to that implementation. For the code details, refer to the notebooks, but here we\\u2019ll briefly touch on each concept. The objective function takes in a set of inputs and returns a score that we want to maximize. In this case, the inputs are the model hyperparameters, and the score is the 5-fold cross validation ROC AUC on the training data. The objective function in pseudo-code is: The goal of hyperparameter optimization is to find the hyperparameters that return the best value when passed into the objective function. That seems pretty simple, but the problem is evaluating the objective function is very expensive in terms of time and computational resources. We cannot try every combination of hyperparameter values because we have a limited amount of time, hence the need for random search and automated methods. The domain is the set of values over which we search. For this problem with a GBM, the domain is as follows: We can visualize two of these distributions, the learning rate, which is logarithmic normal, and the number of leaves which is uniform normal: Although we don\\u2019t generally think of them as such, both grid and random search are algorithms. In the case of grid search, we input the domain and the algorithm selects the next value for each hyperparameter in an ordered sequence. The only requirement of grid search is that it tries every combination in a grid once (and only once). For random search, we input the domain and each time the algorithm gives us a random combination of hyperparameter values to try. There are no requirements for random search other than that the next values are selected at random. Random search can be implemented as in the following: This is in effect a very simple algorithm! The results history is a data structure that contains the hyperparameter combinations and the resulting score on the objective function. When we get to Bayesian Optimization, the model actually uses the past results to decide on the next hyperparmeters to evaluate. Random and grid search are uninformed methods that do not use the past history, but we still need the history so we can find out which hyperparameters worked the best! In this case, the results history is simply a dataframe. Automated hyperparameter tuning with bayesian optimization sounds complicated, but in fact it uses the same four parts as random search with the only difference the Algorithm used. For this competition, I used the Hyperopt library and the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm with the work shown in this notebook. For a conceptual explanation, refer to this article, and for an implementation in Python, check out the notebook or this article. The basic concept of Bayesian optimization is that it uses the previous evaluation results to reason about which hyperparameters perform better and uses this reasoning to choose the next values. Hence, this method should spend fewer iterations evaluating the objective function with poorer values. Theoretically, Bayesian optimization can converge on the ideal values in fewer iterations than random search (although random search can still get lucky)! The aspirations of Bayesian optimization are: This is a powerful method that promises to deliver great results. The question is, does the evidence in practice show this to be the case? To answer that, we turn to the final notebook, a deep dive into the model tuning results! After the hard work of implementing random search and Bayesian optimization, the third notebook is a fun and revealing exploration of the results. There are over 35 plots, so if you like visuals, then check it out. Although I was trying to do the whole competition on Kaggle, for these searches, I did 500 iterations of random search and 400 of Bayesian optimization which took about 5 days each on a computer with 64 GB of RAM (thanks to Amazon AWS). All the results are available, but you\\u2019ll need some serious hardware to redo the experiments! First off: which method did better? The image below summarizes the results from 501 iterations of random search and 402 of Bayesian optimization (called opt in the dataframe): Going by max score, random search does slightly better but if we measure by average score, bayesian optimization wins. The good news is this is almost exactly what we expect: random search can happen upon a great set of values because it thoroughly explores the search space, but Bayesian optimization will \\u201cfocus\\u201d on the highest scoring hyperparameter values by reasoning from previous results. Let\\u2019s take a look at a very revealing plot, the value of the cross validation score versus the number of iterations: We see absolutely no trend for random search, while Bayesian Optimization (again shown by opt ) improves over the trials. If you can understand this graph, then you can see the benefits of both methods: random search explores the search domain but Bayesian optimization gets better over time. We can also see that Bayesian optimization appears to reach a plateau, indicating diminishing returns to further trials. Second major question: what were the best hyperparameter values? Below are the optimal results from Bayesian optimization: We can use these results to build a model and submit predictions to the competition, or they can be used to inform further searches by allowing us to define a concentrated search space around the best values. One interesting aspect to consider is the values tried by each search method for each hyperparameter. The plots below show kernel density estimate (KDE) functions for each of the search methods as well as the sampling distribution (the hyperparameter grid). The dashed vertical lines indicate the optimal value found for each method. First is the learning rate: Even though the learning rate distribution stretched over several orders of magnitude, both methods found optimal values quite low in the domain. We can use this knowledge to inform further hyperparameter searches by concentrating our search in this region. In most cases, a lower learning rate increases the cross validation performance but at the cost of increased run-time, which is a trade-off we have to make. Let\\u2019s look at some other graphs. For most of the hyperparameters, the optimal values from both methods are fairly close, but not for colsample_bytree : This refers to the fraction of columns used when building each tree in the GBM, and random search found the optimal value was higher than Bayesian optimization. Again, these results can be used for further searches, as we see that the Bayesian method tended to concentrate on values around 0.65. We\\u2019ll show two more plots from this analysis because they are fairly interesting, involving two regularization parameters: What\\u2019s noteworthy here is that these two hyperparameters appear to be complements of one another: if one regularization value is high, then we want the other to be low and vice versa. Maybe this helps the model achieve a balance between bias/variance, the most common issue in machine learning. While random search does not change the distribution of values over the search, Bayesian optimization does, by concentrating on where it thinks the best values are in the search domain. We can see this by graphing the hyperparameter values against the iteration: The hyperparameters with the clearest trend are colsample_bytree and learning_rate which both continue downward over the trials. The reg_lambda and reg_alpha are diverging, which confirms our earlier hypothesis that we should decrease one of these while increasing the other. We want to be careful about placing too much value in these results, because the Bayesian optimization might have found a local minimum of the cross validation loss that it is exploiting. The trends here are pretty small, but it\\u2019s encouraging that the best value was found close to the end of the search indicating cross validation scores were continuing to improve. These next plots show the value of a single hyperparameter versus the score. We want to avoid placing too much emphasis on these graphs because we are not changing one hyperparameter at a time and there can be complex interactions between multiple hyperparameters. A truly accurate graph would be 10-dimensional and show the values of all hyperparameters and the resulting score. If we could understand a 10-dimensional graph, then we might be able to figure out the optimal combination of hyperparameters! Here the random search is in blue and the Bayesian in green: The only clear distinction is that the score decreases as the learning rate increases. We cannot say whether that is due to the learning rate itself, or some other factor (we will look at the interplay between the learning rate and the number of estimators shortly). There are not any strong trends here. The score versus subsample is a little off because boosting_type = 'goss' cannot use subsample (it must be set equal to 1.0). While we can\\u2019t look at all 10 hyperparameters at one time, we can view two at once if we turn to 3D plots! To try and examine the simultaneous effects of hyperparameters, we can make 3D plots with 2 hyperparameters and the score. A truly accurate plot would be 10-D (one for each hyperparameter) but in this case we will stick to 3 dimensions. (See the code for details, 3D plotting in Python is surprisingly straightforward). First we can show the reg_alpha and reg_lambda , the regularization hyperparameters versus the score (for Bayesian opt): It\\u2019s a little hard to make sense, but if we remember the best scores occurred around 0.5 for reg_alpha and 0.4 for reg_lambda , we can see generally better scores in this region. Next is the learning_rate and n_estimators (number of decision trees trained in the ensemble). While the learning rate was a hyperparameter in the grid, the number of decision trees (also called the number of boosting rounds) was found by early stopping with 5-fold cross validation: This time there is a clear trend: a lower learning rate and higher number of estimators increases the score. The relationship is expected because a lower learning rate means the contribution of each tree is reduced which necessitates training more trees. The expanded number of trees increases the model\\u2019s capacity to fit the training data (while also increasing the time to run). Moreover, as long as we use early stopping with enough folds, we don\\u2019t have to be concerned about overfitting with more trees. It\\u2019s nice when the results agree with our understanding (although we probably learn more when they don\\u2019t agree!) For the final plot, I wanted to show the correlations between each hyperparameter and each other and the score. These plots can\\u2019t prove causation, but they can tell us which variables are correlated: We already found most of the information from the graphs, but we can see the negative correlation between the learning rate and the score, and the positive correlation between the number of estimators and the score. The final step of the exploration was to implement both the random search best hyperparameters and the Bayesian optimization best hyperparameters on a full dataset (the dataset comes from this kernel and I would like to thank the author for making it public). We train the model, make predictions on the testing set, and finally upload to the competition to see how we do on the public leaderboard. After all the hard work, do the results hold up? If we go by best score on the public leaderboard, Bayesian Optimization wins! However, the public leaderboard is based only on 10% of the test data, so it\\u2019s possible this is a result of overfitting to this particular subset of the testing data. Overall, I would say the complete results \\u2014 including cross validation and public leaderboard \\u2014 suggest that both methods produce similar outcomes when run for enough iterations. All we can say for sure is that either method is better than hand-tuning! Our final model is enough to move us 1000 places up the leaderboard compared to our previous work. Finally, to end with one more plot, we can take a look at the feature importances from the trained GBM: NEW_CREDIT_TO_ANNUITY_RATIO and NEW_EXT_SOURCES_MEAN were features derived by the data science community on Kaggle and not in the original data. It\\u2019s reassuring to see these so high up in the importance because it shows the value of feature engineering. The major takeaways from this work are: Where to go from here? Well, there are always plenty of other methods to try such as automated feature engineering or treating the problem as a time-series. I\\u2019ve already done a notebook on automated feature engineering so that will probably be where my focus will turn next. We can also try other models or even journey into the realm of deep learning! I\\u2019m open to suggestions, so let me know on Kaggle or on Twitter. Thanks for reading, and if you want to check out any of my other work on this problem, here are the complete set of notebooks: There should be enough content there to keep anyone busy for a little bit. Now it\\u2019s off to do more learning/exploration for the next post! The best part about data science is that you\\u2019re constantly on the move, looking for the next technique to conquer. Whenever I find out what that is, I\\u2019ll be sure to share it! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

All code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an applied setting. This version of the Exploratory Data Analysis project has all the code removed for readability. The version with all the R code included is also on Medium. Doctor\\u2019s appointment no-shows are a serious issue in the public health care field. Missed appointments are associated with poorer patient outcomes and cost the health care system in the US nearly $200 each. Therefore, it comes as no small surprise that reducing the rate of no-shows has become a priority in the United States and around the world. Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to determine the most effective means of\\nreducing rates of absenteeism at with varying degrees of success. The first step to solving the problem of missed appointments is identifying why a patient skips a scheduled visit in the first place. What trends are there among patients with higher absence rates? Are there demographic indicators or perhaps time-variant relationships hiding in the data? Ultimately, it was these questions that drove my exploratory data analysis. I was curious as to the reasons behind missed appointments, and wanted to examine the data to identify any trends present. I choose this problem because I believe it is an excellent example of how data science and analysis can reveal relationships which can be implemented in the real-world to the benefit of society. I wanted to choose a dataset that was both relatable and could be used to make smarter decisions. Therefore, I decided to work with medical appointment no shows data available on Kaggle. This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit. There were a total of 14 variables I included from the original data. The variables and the description of the values are as follows Let\\u2019s take a look at the structure of the dataframe to identify cleaning/organizing that may need to be performed. From the structure of the dataframe, I can see there is some data housekeeping that needs to be done. First, I want to change the Status variable into an integer 0 or 1. A value of 1 will indicate that the patient did not show up as I am concerned with the variables that are most strongly correlated with a missed appointment. Moreover, I need to convert the registration date and the appointment date to date objects. I decided not to maintain the time (hours:minutes:seconds) associated with the registration date for the appointment although it was available (time of day was not available for the appointment date). I converted both the appointment registration date and appointment date to date objects so I could investigate seasonal and time patterns in the data. Based on the updated structure of the dataframe, it looks like I am on the right track but I still have a couple more modifications to make to the dataframe. I will create month, year, and day fields for the appointment and also rename the columns to a more consistent and readable format. That should about do it for the structure of the main dataframe. I am also concerned with missing/corrupted data, so I will look at the summary of each field to see if any obvious errors or outliers are present in the data. The summary of the no_shows dataframe reveals plenty of intriguing information as well as several errors that need to be corrected. Right away, it is clear that an age of -2 is not correct, and 113 is stretching the boundaries. However, looking at the oldest people in the world, it is plausible that 113 could be a correct age. I will filter out any negative ages and create a histogram of ages to see if there are a significant amount of outliers at the upper end. Moreover, this data summary shows that 30.24% of appointments are missed based on the mean for the status field. The rates for the various patient conditions can also be seen, and the most commonly coded reason for an appointment is hypertension at nearly 22% of visits. Also, the weekends appear to be a very unpopular time for doctor\\u2019s appointments in Brazil, or perhaps the clinics from which this data was drawn are not open on the weekend. Either way, I will need to keep the small sample size of appointments on the weekend in mind when I perform an analysis by weekday. Frequency Distribution of Ages The age histogram does not aligh exactly with my intutions though it is close. I expected that it would be bi-modal, with peaks in patient count at the youngest ages and at the oldest ages. However, while the largest number of patients do appear to be the youngest, the number of patients remains fairly constant into the middle ages, with a second peak around age 60 and then a steep decline into the oldest ages. Based on the visualization, there do not appear to be a large number of outliers in the upper range of the ages. I was skeptical of the high proportion of visits from those aged 0 and decided I needed to do some research. Based on the description of the dataset, this data is for primary care physicians in the public sector and so I looked for a breakdown of ages of patients at these appointments. I could not find statistics from Brazil, but based on official statistics from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, children under 1 year of age make up 2.6% of all physician visits. I can create a better plot showing the percentage each age is of all patients. I can also quickly check the percentage of visits comprised of patients aged 0 in the data. Percentage of patients with an age of 0:\\n3.442069% The calculation shows that 0-year olds make up 3.44% of visits. While the initial frequency distribution may looked skewed, the spread of the data along the years makes it look like 0-year olds make up considerably more of the visits than is actually the case. The corrected bar plot does a better job of representing the proportion of patients from each age. From the research by the CDC and the visualization, I conclude that the age distribution skew is not bad but rather legitimate data. To check for outliers in the waiting time field (or how long between the date the appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment), I will make another histogram. Based on the summary statistics of the dataframe, the longest waiting time was 398 days, with a median of 8 days, and a mean of 13.84 days. From the histogram and the statistics, it is clear that there are a small number of patients at the upper end of the distribution who schedule their appointment very far in advance. I wonder if the 398 days is accidentally a mistake that occured when someone choose the wrong year for their appointment! The graph is certainly long-tailed and positively skewed with a few extreme outliers at the upper limit. Number of patients with wait time longer than one year:\\n1\\nNumber of patients with wait time longer than six months:\\n136 It appears there is only one patient with a waiting time over one year and just over 100 (out of 300000) with a waiting time of over six months. I will exclude the patient with the waiting time over one year, but I will treat the others as good but extreme data. Here is a version of the histogram that better represents the wait time for most patients. As can be seen in the chart, a plurality of patients wait less than 10 days between the scheduling and the date of their appointment. Based on these visualizations, and the summary statistics for the dataframe, I am confident that the data content of the main dataframe is valid. I can now start the exploration phase of exploratory data analysis! It is time to discover the relationships, or lack thereof, between the variables in the data. The first step I can take is to find the correlations between all of the columns to see if any stand out as particularly compelling. Of course, I expect that all the trends will not reveal themselves straight away. The rcorr function from the Hmisc library will calculate the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coeffient between every field of a dataframe. The Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of how linearly dependent two variables on each other. The coefficient value is between -1 and +1, and two variables that are perfectly linearly correlated will have a value of +1. From those correlation values, there are no standouts that are strong linear predictors of whether or not a patient will miss a visit (given by the status column). It appears that there are not even any strong relationships whatsoever though there is a moderate relationship between age and hypertension. However, I still think there are meaningful relationships to extract from the data. My approach will be to group the data by various fields and then determine if the average absence rate shows a relationship with the fields. The first group of variables I will look at will be those associated with the time-variability of the appointment date. Date of Appointment To start off the time-series analysis, I will want to look at absence rate by month of the year. I first needed to group the appointments by month of year and then find the average absence rate for each month. From the graph and the correlation coefficient, it appears there is a minor relationship between month of the year and absence rate. Missed visits do appear to rise as the year progresses, but with only 12 data points, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient is quite large (-0.05 to 0.85). I would expect that during the end of the year, people tend to be busier and may miss more appointments. It could also be possible that at the beginning of the year, individuals make resolutions to see the doctor and keep a higher percentage of appointments, but the trend could also be noise. Next, I will create a similar absence rate over time graph, but this time by day of the month. Looking at the plot we can see that there is a very slight positive correlation between day of the month and absence rate but again, the 95% confidence interval spans a wide range of values. To further explore any time variability in the data, I can create the same graph by day of the year and broken out by gender. Mean absence rate for males:\\n30.99653%\\nMean absence rate for females\\n29.86962% From these charts, it appears looks as if there is no correlation betwen the time of year and the absence rate for appointments. Moreover, adding in the gender does not reveal any major descrepancies, although from the calculation, we can see that men on average have a 1% higher absence rate. There are several days for which the absence rate is 1, which bears some more investigation. My idea is that these points might corespond to public holidays. However, I also see that these days are not consistent across the two years, so maybe there are other major events that correspond to an increase in absences. I decided to overlay the holidays to see if that might reveal a relationship. I sourced the holidays based on public holidays in Brazil for each respective year. Again, it seems as if these holidays do not line up with higher rates of missed appointments. There is a sustained increase in the absence rate around the beginning of July, but it does not seem to correspond to any holidays. I researched festivals in Brazil in June-July 2015, and it appears that the Paraty International Literary Festival occured July 1\\u20135, but I doubt that this explains the absence rate. There was not city data associated with the original dataset, so it is difficult to attempt to cross-reference specific dates with specific events.\\nI will create a simliar graph for 2014. I remember that the 2014 soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, so perhaps the time around the world cup will have a higher absence rate. I will plot a few holidays and then the dates surrounding the World Cup (which lasted for a month). Perhaps there is a slight increase in absence rate during the World Cup? The graph does not clearly indicate either was but I can compare the average absence rate during the World Cup to the average absence rate over the entire length of 2014.Mean absence rate during all of 2014\\\\ [1] 30.08656\\nMean absence rate during 2014 World Cup\\n[1] 30.79473 There is a small but not significant increase in the absence rate during the World Cup. It looks like in terms of time variability, there is no significant correlation based on the day of the year or the day of the month. There is one more time variation I want to look at, and that is day of the week. To remind myself of the small sample sizes on the weekend, I also show the appointment days of the week count. Finally, it looks like there might be some time variability in this data when it is broken down by weekday. Excluding Saturday and Sunday because of their small sample sizes, Monday and Friday have the highest absence rate and Tuesday has the lowest. I will alter the plot to show the absence rate as a relative percentage change from the overall mean absence rate. Based on this chart, patients are 6% more likely to miss an appointment on a Monday compared to the overall average absence rate, and 4% less likely to miss an appointment on a Tuesday. This is an actionable discovery for both patients and doctors! If patients want to keep their appointments, and if doctors want to make sure their patients show up, they should schedule their appointments during the middle three days of the week. Patient Age I wanted to move on from the time variability and look at the demographic data. In particular, I am interested in whether or not age is correlated with absence rate. My initial guess would be that the youngest and the oldest patients would tend to have lower absence rates. Meanwhile, those patients in the middle would generally be healthier and thus would feel more inclined to skip an appointment. (Everyone is convinced they are invincible in their 20s. In fact, this was one of the issues associated with the initial rollout of Obamacare. Too many young, healthy individuals did not believe they needed insurance and therefore did not sign up for healthcare.) First I will group patients by age and then visualize the average absence rates. The chart reveals the possibility of a negative relationship between age and absence rate. First though, it is clear that the outliers in the upper end of the data introduce substantial variance. As there are only 719 patients over 90 out of 300000 entries, I think I can filter out any ages over 90 without impacting the validating of the data while reducing the noise. I will use that filter and then improve the aesthetics of the graph. We can observe that the youngest ages have a relatively low absence rate with an exception for 1-year-olds. The absence rate then climbs for teenagers, peaking around age 20, before beginning a long, gradual decline to around 70, at which point the absence rate rises again slightly. I would like to know precisely which ages have the highest and lowest absence rates. Moreover, what is the pearson correlation between age and absence rate? Maximum absence rate of 40.21% occurs at age 18\\nMinimum absence rate of 20.25% occurs at age 72 Here are more actionable conclusions. Public health officials need to work on getting teenagers to show up to their appointments! This is expecially crucial because studies have shown that habits form very early and are hard to change later in life. A trend of going to the doctor while younger will likely persist as a patient ages and lead to better lifelong health. We can further bin the data in five years increments to highlight the \\u201cproblem years\\u201d, that is, the years with the highest missed appointment rate. I will plot the relative absence rate, or the average age group absence rate as a percentage relative to the average absence rate for all ages. Remember, in this plot, below the x-axis is better because it indicates that the age group has a lower rate of missed appointments than the average. Based on the chart, is it clear that the worst group in terms of absence rate is 15\\u201320 year-olds and the best group for attedance is 70\\u201375 year-olds. The visualization and the statistics are definitive when it comes to ages and missed appointments. The correlation between ages and absence rate is -0.86, which is strongly negative and indicates that as the age of the patient increases, statistically, that patient is less likely to miss a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. Waiting Time After finding a strong relationship between age and absence rate, I will move on to examine other variables. I would like to search for a possible trend in absence rate by waiting time, or the time between when an appointment was scheduled, and when the appointment took place. My hypothesis is that patients with a longer waiting time will have a higher missed appointment rate because their condition has more time to change in the interim period. Moreover, I think that patients with a shorter waiting time are more likely to need urgent care or have a problem they deem to be pressing, and it would certainly be in their best interest to show up at the appointment. The graph and the correlation coefficient seem to demonstrate a lack of any relationship. However, thinking back on the histogram of waiting time from the initial exploration, the majority of the patients waited under 100 days. There are far fewer data points from people waiting more than 100 days, which is why the average absence rate for those times tends to be either 0% or 100%. If I limit the data to people with a waiting time less than 3 months (90 days), might there exist a relationship? Furthermore, I will group the data into 10 day segments. Patients with a waiting time over 90 days\\n1646 If the data is limited to those patients who scheduled fewer than 3 months in advance, there is a slight positive correlation between waiting time and absence rate. I tried to do some research on this subject in general, and found this from the Safety Net Dental Clinic: \\u201cExperience in many safety net dental programs also suggests that the incidence of broken appointments increases when appointments are scheduled more than three weeks in advance.\\u201d Based on my analysis, I concur. Patients who schedule less than 10 days out are 20% less likely to miss an appointment than those scheduling further out. The Safety Net Dental Clinic page mentions that often other life events get in the way when we schedule too far out, and although that may be a slightly different situation, the general pattern appears to hold in this case. Add a point to schedule as few days out as possible to the list of recommendations for patients looking to adhere to a scheduled appointment. SMS Reminders One of the most intriguing aspects of the dataset to me was the SMS (Short Message Service) text message reminder counts. Text message reminders have been implemented in many clinics because of their ease of use and low cost. Moreover, they have been shown to be effective in some situations. I want to examine this data to discover how or if SMS messages correlate with a failure to attend. I would think that patients who recieve SMS messages will be more likely to attend the appointment than those not receiving them. However, this could be complicated by the fact that younger patients are more likely to sign up for text message alerts, and as we have already seen, young individuals are more inclined to be record a no-show. Therefore, I will probably need to further look at who exactly is recieving the text messages in addition to the correlation between text messages and attendance at the appointment. The graph is somewhat surprising to me; one text message seems to decrease the absence rate while two increases the absence rate significantly. I would have expected more SMS reminders to be strongly correlated with a decrease in absence rate. Maybe the direction of this relationship is the opposite of what I thought. Instead of SMS messages persuading patients to attend a scheduled appointment, patients who are least likely to attend an appointment receive more text messages. One way to check for this would be to look at average SMS messages per appointment received by age. I expect there might be odd behavior at the ends of this graph (how young do children receive their first phone nowadays? Has the average 80-year old embraced text messages?). I expect that segmenting by age might reveal more nuances than the overall absence rate vs text messages. Sure enough, the average number of SMS reminders per appointment is greater among the younger ages. I looked through the data provider information, and I could not ascertain whether or not those SMS reminders were to the parent in the case of a very young child but that seems likely. From the statistics and the plot, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of SMS messages and the age of the patient. To further explore the absence rate vs text message, I will recreate the absence rate vs age graph, but this time, create separate curves for number of SMS reminders received. Looking at the graph, we can see that the absence rate versus age grouped by number of SMS reminders looks much the same for the 0 or 1 reminders. However, the graph for 2 reminders is much noisier. I suspect that is due to the lower sample size of people receiving two reminders (which was the maximum). In order to determine if there is an effect from text message reminders at a given age, I need to create a plot showing the difference in absence rates at each age between those receiving any reminder and those receiving no reminder. Indeed, it does appears that at a given age, the absence rate decreases with 1 or 2 text messages reminders. In fact, the average difference in absence rate holding age constant is -0.57%. That means that having receiving an SMS reminder at a given age decreases the chance that a patient will miss a scheduled appointment by 0.6%. This may seem small, but it could add up over millions of appointments. Moreover, there are certain ages when the effect of the SMS reminders is much greater. The reduction in missed appointments is as great as 2% at age ten and near 3% during other years. This reduction in the failure to attend rate is also what research into text message reminders has found. One study,conducted in Brazil, found: \\u201cThe nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p = .590), 3.55% (p = .009), 5.75% (p = .022), and 14.49% (p = <.001).\\u201d Furthermore, the conclusion of this research was: \\u201cThe study results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients\\u2019 cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving uninterrupted care benefit.\\u201d Based on my analysis of the data, I must concur that at a given age, SMS reminders decrease the absence rate. Another valuable piece of information that could be quite easily implemented in the real world to improve outcomes! Patient Markers The final step in this exploratory analysis is to look at the absence rate by the condition for which the patient visited the doctor. I will group by the markers in the original data and then look at each average absence rate. There are considerable differences illustrated between those with different markers. Tuberculosis has the highest rate of absence, followed by alcoholism. However, these conditions also make up a small sample of the overall visits. Diabetes and hypertension have the lowest absence rate. Interestingly, patients marked as being part of the Bolsa Familia welfare program have a high rate of absences. This program rewards patients for attending appointments, which should induce patients to visit their doctor more often. Perhaps there are other factors at play here though. It could be that families on the welfare program cannot take the time to visit the doctor because of the opportunity cost of not working. To put the conditions in perspective, here is the percentage of all visits each condition makes up. The final plot I can make is of the conditions and the relative percentage difference in absence rates compared to the mean absence rate. Relative difference plots are helpful to me because it is possible to quickly identify if one variable is above or below the average. Again, for this particular plot, values below the x-axis are great because it means the absence rate is lower than the overall average. The differences between conditions here are stark. Again, the smaller sample sizes associated with alcoholism and tuberculosis must be taken into account, but it is clear that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to attend an appointment. In fact, they are more than 15% less likely to miss an appointment then the average patient. This is an interesting result and I wonder if it is because of the constant need for care when treating both of these conditions. However, it would seem like all of the conditions require care on an ongoing basis. I would need more detailed condition information before I drew any conclusions about possible causes of the absence rates broken out by condition. I started this project off with a single simple question: what factors are most likely to determine whether or not a patient shows up to their scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment? As the exploratory data analysis went on, I found this one question had branched into dozens. Does the number of SMS reminders correlate with absence rates? How about if we compare SMS reminders for a given age? Are there major variabilities that we can observe associated with holidays? I found my curiousity and interest in the dataset only grew as I delved further and further. Although at first it appeared there were few meaningful relationships, by grouping and segmenting the data, clear trends emerged. Keeping in mind that this dataset may not be representative of all countries and health care systems, the following are the most notable discoveries from the patient no-show data: 2. There is a slight positive correlation between absence rate and the day of the month and as the month progresses, the percentage of missed appointments rises moderately. 3. There is no correlation in the absence rate over the days of the year. 4. Excluding the weekends, the day of the week with the highest absence rate is Monday followed by Friday. Tuesday had the lowest rate of absences with appointments on Tuesday 4% more likely to be attended than those on the other days of the week. 5. The age of patients was demonstrated a strong negative linear correlation with absence rates with a correlation coefficient of -0.86. 6. There was a slight positive correlation between the rate of missed appointments and how many days in advance the patient scheduled the appointment. 7. When looking at the dataset as a whole, patients who recieved two SMS reminders were more likely to miss an appointment than those who recieved no reminders. However, the correlation between age and average text messages recieved was -0.80 meaning that younger patients, who were more likely to miss appointments overall, received more text messages. Subsequently, the effect of text messages reminders can only be revealed by looking at messages received at a given age. 8. Patients whose appointments were marked for tuberculosis and alcoholism were the most likely to miss the visit, while those coded for hypertension and diabetes were the least likely to miss their appointment. These are but a few briefs observations that can be gleaned from this dataset. Keeping in mind that correlations do not imply causations (more serious link for those interested), and that some of the groupings results in small sample sizes, there are actionable items that with appropriate further study, could be implemented in the health care system. The final aspect of the project was to revisit and refine three of my earlier plots. Primarily I am concerned with whether or not the visualizations correctly convey the information within the dataset. My secondary objective is of course aesthetics because what good is even the most informative chart if it is not presentable? Absence Rate vs. Day of the Year This first chart was notable to me because of the lack of relationships it revealed. It is the graph of absence rate versus day of the year in 2014 with holidays (and the World Cup) included. I would have initially believed that absence rates spiked around holidays and near the end of the year. However, no clear trend emerged from this plot. In order to improve the information content and the aesthetics, I altered some of the colors, changed the scale on the axis, added in the mean absence rate for reference, and made sure all labels were accurate. The conclusion to draw from this visualization is that there is no trend in rate of missed appointments over the year by day. Even on major public holidays (of which the World Cup may be the greatest!) there is no noticeable change in absence rate around or on the holiday. This was backed up by the correlation coefficient which showed no linear relationship between day of year and the failure to attend statistic. The overall mean, plotted as the horizontal black line, shows the absence rate for all patients was 30.24%. Women on average had a slightly lower rate of 29.87% and men had a slightly higher rate at 31.00%. The gender discrepancy can barely be picked out on the graph, but it is present. Absence Rate vs. Age by SMS Reminders The second crucial visualization is the absence rate versus age broken down by number of SMS reminders. When I initially looked at the data showing that overall, people who received 2 text message reminders had higher absences rates, I was a little skeptical. However, after some thought, I realized that people who received text messages were likely to be younger, and I had seen that the younger the patient, the higher the absence rate. Therefore, I decided to look at the effect of text messages reminders at each given age. Based on the resulting chart, I saw that indeed, SMS reminders do reduce the absence rate at a specific age. To make the point clearer in the plot below, I plotted the average absence rate vs age for those who received no text reminders and for those who received either 1 or 2 reminders. The original graph was very noisy, so I applied a moving average over 5 years. The 5 year window was a selection based on the bias-variance tradeoff because while I wanted a smoother plot, I did not want to introduce a high amount of bias into the averages. After improving the graph, it is possible to observe the trend of fewer absences at older ages and the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing the failure to attend rate. The main two takeaways from this visualization are that as age increases, the absence rate decreases, and, at a given age, patients who receive at least one SMS reminder miss fewer appointments. The age distribution of missed appointments was in line with what I had expected, although I would have initially guessed that children under 10 would have the low absence rates comparable to what was observed in those aged 40 and over. It was not surprising to me that patients in their teens and early 20s had the highest failure to attend rate and it is clear that more effort needs to be expended in ensuring that this age group shows up for their appointments. This is one application where text message reminders could be most useful. Looking at the chart, it is also possible to observe that the rate of no-shows for those receiving an SMS reminder is lower than that for those recieving no reminder at almost every age. Overall, for a given age, text message reminders resulted in absence rates 0.5% lower which could make a substantial impact on the scale on a national health care system. Absence Rate vs. Waiting Time The third vital graph from this analysis was the relative absence rate vs waiting time graph. This graph displays the absence rate relative the overall mean absence rate for patient groups based on how far in advance they scheduled their appointment. I initially grouped the waiting time, or the elasped days between when the appointment was made and when the appointment occurred, by groups of five days. I then plotted the relative absence rate compared to the overall average for each group. I was surprised to discover how much lower the absence rate was for those sceduling less than 10 days in advance. To improve the plot, I increased the resolution of the graph by narrowing the bin widths to groups of 3 days. I also decided to add in a model created with the LOESS, Local Regression, method of regression. I created a simple model and then used the prediction it generated for each age grouping to draw a curve. The graph reveals the crucial information that appointments scheduled shorter out tend to have higher attendance rates. The actionable takeaway for patients from this graph is to schedule appointments on a shorter time scale, preferentially less than 10 days in advance. The absence rate for those whose appointments were scheduled only 3 days or less in advance was nearly 30% lower relative to the overall absence rate. Moreover, the model shows that the trend in increasing absence rate with longer waiting times is nearly linear for the first month. After that point, the noise in the visualization increases, but the majority of groups with wait times over 12 days had a higher absence rate than the mean. Patients would be wise to schedule their appointments as soon as possible in order to follow through on visiting the doctor. Taken together, these three visualizations illustrate several pieces of advice for patients and doctors who have a mutal interest in driving the absence rate as low as possible:\\n1. Day of the year does not affect the absence rate even near the holidays.\\n2. Young adults are the most likely to miss their appointments and therefore will need extra prodding to attend an appointment. This prodding can come in the form of SMS reminders, which reduce the absence rate for a given age.\\n3. Patients should schedule appointments as few days in advance as possible. Ideally appointments would occur within 9 days of being scheduled to increase the chance of attendance. The primary reason I wanted to learn the tools of data analysis was in order to could extract meaningful information from the mounds of data generated in our modern world. I want to be able to take hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points and extract insights which can be implemented in the real world to improve human institutions, such as the medical system. Exploring the patient no-show dataset has been a small step towards developing that ability. Although the sheer amount of data appeared overwhelming at first, and there were no correlations that immediately stood out, by selectively grouping the data and adjusting the visualization parameters, I was able to discover several key relationships.\\nThe main difficulty I had was beginning the analysis. With so many variables, it was a struggle to decide where I should first concentrate. However, once I started grouping the data, I found more and more directions I could explore until I felt that I was satisfied with the extent to which I had unraveled the data. The trends and patterns in the datadictate the questions that we should ask of it. R is a tricky language to pick up, but once I understood the patterns and syntax, I enjoyed the level of control it gave me over the visualizations. I was frustrated at times trying to perfect parameters of a graph, but in the end, I think I am a better data analyst because I had to work through all the intricacies of the R language. The next step forward, now that the exploratory data analysis of the no-shows dataset is complete, is to perform confirmatory data analysis. Based on my initial observations, I could form several hypotheses and then use rigorous statistical methods to test those hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis can discover potential relationships, but it takes statistical testing to determine whether these correlations are statistically meaningful. Moreover, this dataset is an ideal candidate for using machine learning to create classifiers that would identify patients likely to be a no-show at an appointment. The objective would be to make a model that would take in as features patient demographics and conditions, and would return the likelihood that a patient would fail to attend a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. If the model was accurate enough, it could then be implemented in the real-world by ensuring that patients most likely to miss a doctor\\u2019s visit receive additional persuasion. Moreover, with a more complete dataset, including city information or detailed demographics, more relationships could be discovered such as absence rate correlations with the weather or with access to public transportation. The initial exploratory data analysis of the doctor\\u2019s appointment no-show data has revealed numerous potential relationships. The dataset holds actionable information and this project demonstrates the benefits of not just collecting large amounts of data, but thoroughly analyzing it to find the correlations that could be used to improve patient outcomes and public health.

The grandeur of this assertion should immediately raise our suspicions; as the science popularizer Carl Sagan often said, \\u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\\u201d Does Pinker have that evidence and does he interpret it correctly? Over the course of 800 pages, Pinker makes a convincing argument with numbers, figures, and references to many books and articles. Nonetheless, it\\u2019s critical that we don\\u2019t rely on a single argument to form our worldview. We must remember that data is never objective, and therefore we need to look at the data itself as well as multiple expert interpretations. In this article, we\\u2019ll examine the global violent conflict data and different stances on the same numbers. (As a note, Pinker\\u2019s work deals with all forms of violence from the individual \\u2014 homicides, abuse \\u2014 to the worldwide, but here we\\u2019ll focus on international violent conflicts \\u2014 war \\u2014 and leave the rest for future articles). This is Episode 2 of the Reality Project, an endeavor with the aim of becoming less wrong about the world with data. You can find all the articles here. (I\\u2019d like to emphasize I\\u2019m not trying to minimize the atrocities of war by presenting only data. It can be easy to lose track that we are talking about people when looking at numbers and every loss of human life is a tragedy.) Our primary sources of derived data on the more positive side will be The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker and the \\u201cWar and Peace\\u201d page on Our World in Data. For a contrasting viewpoint, we\\u2019ll use \\u201cSteven Pinker is Wrong\\u201d by John Gray and \\u201cThe Decline of Conflict: What Do the Data Really Say?\\u201d by Pasquale Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. You can find raw data for your own analysis at The Conflict Catalog or the World Bank. The first question we need to ask to assess violence today is how violent was the past. While extremely reliable data is difficult to come by, anthropologists use archaeological evidence to determine causes of death and therefore approximate the rates of violence in a society. These results are shown in the following graphs of percentages of deaths that come from violent conflict in prehistoric and non-state societies (from Our World in Data). The percentages of individuals killed by violence ranges from about 60% to less than 5% in both prehistoric and nonstate societies. Those numbers are almost meaningless until we put them in perspective with modern figures: The most relevant entries are the final two. The US and Europe from 1900\\u20131960, even with two world wars, saw less than 1% of their population perish in armed conflicts. In 2007, just 0.04% of deaths in the world were from international violence. If this data is correct, the world in 2007 was at least an order of magnitude safer than most prehistoric societies. We can also look at the same data in a slightly different manner, as the violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per year. Here we again see the same pattern of lower violence in modern times. On the left are non-state societies and on the right are state societies. Focusing on the bottom 3 rows of the right-hand table, we can see the strikingly low rates of violent death among modern societies, even accounting for two world wars. Again, it\\u2019s worth stressing the data here is not complete, but what is available suggests the following hypothesis: prehistoric and nonstate societies experienced much higher rates of violence than modern state societies. As Pinker and others (notably Jared Diamond) have made clear, the \\u201cnoble savage\\u201d idea is entirely false. People did not live peacefully with one another when they were organized in tribes and then become more violent as they were civilized, but the opposite: they were extremely violent in tribes and gradually became less so as larger civilizations were built and commerce started to connect the world (this highlights two of the drivers in the decline of global war \\u2014 trade and powerful states \\u2014 that we\\u2019ll look at shortly). Even accounting for the atrocities wrought by nation-states in the 20th century, rates of violent death appear to be lower now than at any previous point. It\\u2019s worth looking into the period of time for which we have the best data: the modern age. In particular, we\\u2019ll zoom in on the post-1945 era, a time that Pinker has classified as \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d. From this vantage point, things look very good. As noted by Pinker, since 1953, there have been zero conflicts between major world powers (the exception since WW2 was the Korean War) and there have been zero internationally recognized states that have gone out of existence through conquest since 1945. When we look at the data on battle deaths per 100,000 people in state-based conflicts, we see a significant decline since World War Two. Since the end of the second world war, the rate of deaths from all conflicts has decreased, with the most noticeable decline in conflicts between states. Most of the remaining battle deaths occur in civil conflicts, such as the tragic civil war in Syria that has been ongoing since 2011. Moreover, many of these civil wars involve foreign states, and the argument could be made major states have stopped fighting each other directly, but engage through other conflicts. One discouraging bit of news in contrast to the above graph is the number of overall state conflicts since the second world war: While the number of battle-related deaths (in the rate of people killed / 100,000 / year) has decreased, the total number of conflict is rising. This tells us that, contrary to what we might think as weapon technology advances, violent conflicts are resulting in fewer battle deaths. While, there are more civil conflicts around the globe, these tend to be less catastrophic than wars between major powers. Fortunately, the wars between major states have been on the decline \\u2014 even including the entire 20th century \\u2014 and show no signs of reversal. We can see this in the final chart of section showing the percent of the time major powers have been at war over the past 500 years (grouped into 25-year periods). There has been a clear decline in the percentage of years in which the major powers fought with one another since at least 1600. At one point the rate reached 100% \\u2014 indicating there was at least one conflict between world powers for the entire 25-year period. Contrast that with 2000, when there were 0 conflicts between world powers. The current period of 66 years without a conflict between major powers is the longest time since at least the Roman Empire. After an exploration of the data thus far, Pinker\\u2019s argument looks to be holding up: the rate of death in battle for modern state societies in war is much lower than prehistoric and non-state societies even accounting for the world wars. Furthermore, the major powers no longer fight one another and while the number of civil conflicts has increased, these result in fewer deaths than conflicts between major states. However, before we consider this case to be closed we need to talk about one fundamental issue. Consider the following two scenarios: Which is worse? The question depends on your observation point. On the ground, observing from the location of the conflict itself, the bar is much worse. An individual in the bar has a 1 in 2 chance of being killed. From an outsider\\u2019s vantage point the civil war is much worse with a total loss of life 10 times greater. This is one of the central arguments that Pinker\\u2019s critics make: measuring violence in rates ignores the absolute numbers which means it does not account for the actual amount of human suffering. One of Pinker\\u2019s harshest critics, Nassim Taleb, brings up the point of units in his response. He illustrates it with the following pair of plots: The graph on the left shows the raw number of casualties versus time for major conflicts. The graph on the right shows the rescaled version where the populations have been standardized across all times to have the same base population. As an example, if we have a population 100 society that suffers 2 deaths and a society with 1000 people that suffers 10, we would multiply 2 * 10 to get 20 deaths to account for the population difference. These figures encapsulate the rates/absolute numbers argument: the rates of death in violent conflicts have clearly been decreasing and are at a historical low, but the actual number of deaths has increased over time. Although, it\\u2019s worth pointing out the actual number has decreased since 1950. I don\\u2019t know if I have an answer for you on this problem of relative/absolute. As a utilitarian, I believe in bringing the greatest amount of total good to the greatest amount of people, and therefore, I see the total number of humans dead as the mark of how our civilization has failed. On the other side of the argument, a human alive today has less probability of being killed in a violent conflict than at any point in the past which is no doubt progress. I\\u2019ll let the facts stand and allow you to decide for yourself. Even if we don\\u2019t want to make a judgment on the overall outcome, it\\u2019s worth taking a look at the potential causes for the reduction in rates of violence. In particular, we might want to think about why the total number of deaths (in addition to the relative measures) have fallen since 1945. For this section, we will look at Steven Pinker\\u2019s ideas as outlined in The Better Angels of Our Nature. (This work is the best look at potential reasons why violence has declined \\u2014 partly because others refuse to concede this point). Pinker explains five forces, intended to account for the decline of violence on all scales, not just state-based conflicts, but we\\u2019ll focus on the first two which are most relevant to international conflict. The five historical forces behind the reduction in violence are: A powerful central government that can make and enforce laws using violence means that citizens are less likely to take punishment into their own hands, a concept known as the Leviathon theory. For all its romantic appeal, vigilante justice only leads to unending cycles of revenge violence. When citizens can count on a government to deliver fair punishments, they let the judicial system enforce the rules. Also, a state can prevent crime by making the penalty far greater than any potential payoff. Humans have the potential for both evil and good, and a strong central government with a fair criminal justice system with disincentives can steer them on the right path. A strong government alone is not enough for keeping the peace between nations though. On an international scale, the evidence suggests that democracies don\\u2019t fight each other possibly because of the ideals they share in common. Looking at some of the data, it\\u2019s clear that democracies just don\\u2019t fight one another directly anymore (although they may engage in proxy war). (For more on this concept see \\u201cDemocratic Peace Theory.\\u201d) The idea that one democratic nation will not fight another is good news as democracies on the rise in the long run worldwide as shown by Pinker: (One counterpoint is the recent decline in Democratic Index which measures not just the government but also freedom of the press and voting rights. Although the long-term trends are positive, the recent declines are worrying.) The theory of gentle commerce can be summed up in two statements: Why don\\u2019t you steal a loaf of bread from the grocery store? Although most people believe they don\\u2019t steal because it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do, the real reason is more mundane: in our society, the potential cost of getting caught stealing \\u2014 jail time and social ostracization \\u2014 are higher than the cost to purchase items. When people are provided a legal means to obtain their goods that is cheaper than violence, they will take the legal option. We explored the second point in \\u201cThe Disappearing Poor\\u201d, but it\\u2019s worth reiterating. Without exchanges in a market economy, all interactions between humans are zero-sum: you can steal something from me, but your gain is offset by my loss so humanity is no better off; the size of the economy stays the same. However, in an exchange of goods, both parties come out better ahead. Exchange also allows for specialization so different individuals/countries can make the goods for which they are best suited. Moreover, as trade continues, countries become dependent on one another because they no longer make all the goods they need. The end result of exchange is more plentiful goods at cheaper prices for all parties and improved international relations. Over the past several hundred years, we have slowly built up an international marketplace where all players are heavily dependent on one another. The US will not fight with another major power, not because she couldn\\u2019t defeat them, but because the economic losses would far outweigh the gains. As discussed by Pinker, countries that depend more on each other for trade are less likely to have a violent conflict controlling for other factors. In summary, the financial incentives have switched from war to trade for most nations. The Leviathon and gentle commerce actually work together \\u2014 a strong government is able to create markets that allow for safe exchanges and enforce laws regulating trade. In other words, once you have a strong state, trading is easier, and more trading between nations means they are less likely to attack one another. As trade between world powers has increased, conflicts between major powers has also decreased to 0 since 1953. There are doubtless other factors that have played a role in the decline of war between nations. We discussed external historical factors behind the decrease, but Pinker and others (John Horgan in The End of War) have also outlined internal factors, like The Better Angels of Our Nature : empathy, self-control, morals, reason. By examining the data and the reasons, it\\u2019s clear that the major powers no longer see war as a feasible choice. This is not necessarily because they are ethical, but because the economics of war no longer makes sense. At the end of the day, humans \\u2014 and nations \\u2014 are driven by incentives, and through international trade, we have built a world where the incentives favor peace. In a narrow point of view, Pinker is correct: rates of violent conflict have substantially decreased and there is reason to believe they are at the lowest point in human history (if only because data is limited). Also, at least among modern democracies, violence is no longer seen as the default option for solving problems as it has been for almost all of human history. That being said, it\\u2019s worth thinking about how Pinker\\u2019s argument made be misleading. The first point is that by focusing on rates rather than numbers, we are neglecting the actual human suffering. More people dying from war is more people dying from war even if the percentage is decreasing. The numbers can be used to support multiple conclusions depending on one\\u2019s argument. A second central issue is, especially for pre-historic societies, reliable data is hard to get. Most of the numbers for conflict rates and deaths in prehistoric societies come by examining archaeological sites and looking at artifacts for evidence of violent death. However, it could be possible these marks have been misinterpreted and anthropologists could not possibly have studied all prehistoric societies. Simple extrapolation what has been found is the only option, but it\\u2019s also important to not draw immature conclusions. The last major issue we\\u2019ll cover here (for more see Taleb\\u2019s article) is that we could be living in an anomalous age. Pinker calls the most recent 70 years of peace (no wars between modern nations), \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d, but it could be really only the temporary peace. Furthermore, as pointed out by Taleb, wars tend to be power law distributed, that is, they have long tails skewed to the right. The vast majority of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by a small number of the conflicts as can be seen below: One single conflict can completely outweigh all others in terms of deaths. Most of the armed conflicts since 1945 have fallen on the low end of the scale, but it only takes a single major battle to overshadow the peace since 1945. It\\u2019s possible a new conflict, one caused by global warming, resource shortages, or territorial disputes, could entirely undo the millennia of progress humans have made on violence reduction efforts. Initially, after reading Pinker\\u2019s book, I was convinced by his thesis. However, after taking the time to dig through the facts myself, a more nuanced picture emerged, one where sensationalist conflicts on both sides are not warranted. I see reasons for optimism: decreasing rates of deaths in armed conflicts mean a human alive today is less likely to die in battle than in recorded history, no battles between major powers since 1953, and a reduction in overall battle deaths since the 1950s, as well as reasons for pessimism: democracy and international trade, so important for reducing major conflicts, appear to be on a decline in recent years. Moreover, while major powers no longer fight directly with each other, they are involved through proxy wars. The exploration of violent conflict highlights the objective of the Reality Project. It\\u2019s not designed to be a feel-good effort but a fact-based endeavor, and, thus, any time I encounter an argument that is appealing to me this should only tell me to be more skeptical. The Reality Project has allegiances to no single interest, except getting at the actual statistics behind our world. It\\u2019s nice when the facts make us optimistic, but even when they don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s critical to understand the data so we can work to improve things.

It\\u2019s a machine learning education disguised as a competition! Although there are valid criticisms of Kaggle, overall, it\\u2019s a great community that provides interesting problems, thousands of data scientists willing to share their knowledge, and an ideal environment for exploring new ideas. As evidence of this, I never would have learned about the Gradient Boosting Machine, or, one of the topics of this article, automated model optimization, were it not for the Kaggle Home Credit contest. In this article, part three of a series (Part One: Getting Started and Part Two: Improving) documenting my work for this contest, we will focus on a crucial aspect of the machine learning pipeline: model optimization through hyperparameter tuning. In the second article, we decided on the Gradient Boosting Machine as our model of choice, and now we have to get the most out of it through optimization. We\\u2019ll do this primarily with two methods: random search and automated tuning with Bayesian optimization. All the work presented here is available to run on Kaggle in the following notebooks. The article itself will highlight the key ideas but the code details are all in the notebooks (which are free to run with nothing to install!) For this article we will skip the background, so if at any time you feel lost, I encourage you to go to the previous articles and notebooks. All of the notebooks can be run on Kaggle without the need to download anything, so I highly recommend checking them out or competing! In the first part of this series, we got familiar with the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, tried our hand at feature engineering, and built a few baseline models. Our public leaderboard score from this round was 0.678 (which at the moment would place us lower than 4000 on the leaderboard). Part two involved in-depth manual feature engineering, followed by feature selection and more modeling. Using the expanded (and then contracted) set of features, we ended up with a score of 0.779, quite an improvement from the baseline, but not quite in the top 50% of competitors. In this article, we will once again better our score and move up 1000 places on the leaderboard. Optimization in the context of machine learning means finding the set of model hyperparameter values that yield the highest cross validation score for a given dataset. Model hyperparameters, in contrast to model parameters that are learned during training, are set by the data scientist before training. The number of layers in a deep neural network is a model hyperparameter while the splits in a decision tree are model parameters. I like to think of model hyperparameters as settings that we need to tune for a dataset: the ideal combination of values is different for every problem! There are a handful of ways to tune a machine learning model: These are presented in order of increasing efficiency, with manual search taking the most time (and often yielding the poorest results) and automated methods converging on the best values the quickest, although, as with many topics in machine learning, this is not always the case! As shown in this great paper, random search does surprisingly well (which we\\u2019ll see shortly). (There are also other hyperparameter tuning methods such as evolutionary and gradient-based. There are constantly better methods being developed, so make sure to stay up to date on the current best practice!) In the second part of this series, we decided to use the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model because of its superior performance on structured data with many features. The GBM is extremely powerful (yet easy to implement in Python), but it has dozens of hyperparameters that significantly affect performance and which must be optimized for a problem. If you want to feel overwhelmed, check out the documentation on the LightGBM library: I don\\u2019t think there is anyone in the world who can look at all of these and pick the best values! Therefore, we need to implement one of the four methods for choosing the hyperparameters. For this problem, I didn\\u2019t even try manual tuning, both because this was my first time working with the GBM and because I didn\\u2019t want to waste any time. e\\u2019ll skip straight to random search and automated techniques using Bayesian optimization. In the first notebook, we go through an implementation of grid and random search covering the four parts of an optimization problem: These four parts also form the basis of Bayesian optimization, so laying them out here will help when it comes to that implementation. For the code details, refer to the notebooks, but here we\\u2019ll briefly touch on each concept. The objective function takes in a set of inputs and returns a score that we want to maximize. In this case, the inputs are the model hyperparameters, and the score is the 5-fold cross validation ROC AUC on the training data. The objective function in pseudo-code is: The goal of hyperparameter optimization is to find the hyperparameters that return the best value when passed into the objective function. That seems pretty simple, but the problem is evaluating the objective function is very expensive in terms of time and computational resources. We cannot try every combination of hyperparameter values because we have a limited amount of time, hence the need for random search and automated methods. The domain is the set of values over which we search. For this problem with a GBM, the domain is as follows: We can visualize two of these distributions, the learning rate, which is logarithmic normal, and the number of leaves which is uniform normal: Although we don\\u2019t generally think of them as such, both grid and random search are algorithms. In the case of grid search, we input the domain and the algorithm selects the next value for each hyperparameter in an ordered sequence. The only requirement of grid search is that it tries every combination in a grid once (and only once). For random search, we input the domain and each time the algorithm gives us a random combination of hyperparameter values to try. There are no requirements for random search other than that the next values are selected at random. Random search can be implemented as in the following: This is in effect a very simple algorithm! The results history is a data structure that contains the hyperparameter combinations and the resulting score on the objective function. When we get to Bayesian Optimization, the model actually uses the past results to decide on the next hyperparmeters to evaluate. Random and grid search are uninformed methods that do not use the past history, but we still need the history so we can find out which hyperparameters worked the best! In this case, the results history is simply a dataframe. Automated hyperparameter tuning with bayesian optimization sounds complicated, but in fact it uses the same four parts as random search with the only difference the Algorithm used. For this competition, I used the Hyperopt library and the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm with the work shown in this notebook. For a conceptual explanation, refer to this article, and for an implementation in Python, check out the notebook or this article. The basic concept of Bayesian optimization is that it uses the previous evaluation results to reason about which hyperparameters perform better and uses this reasoning to choose the next values. Hence, this method should spend fewer iterations evaluating the objective function with poorer values. Theoretically, Bayesian optimization can converge on the ideal values in fewer iterations than random search (although random search can still get lucky)! The aspirations of Bayesian optimization are: This is a powerful method that promises to deliver great results. The question is, does the evidence in practice show this to be the case? To answer that, we turn to the final notebook, a deep dive into the model tuning results! After the hard work of implementing random search and Bayesian optimization, the third notebook is a fun and revealing exploration of the results. There are over 35 plots, so if you like visuals, then check it out. Although I was trying to do the whole competition on Kaggle, for these searches, I did 500 iterations of random search and 400 of Bayesian optimization which took about 5 days each on a computer with 64 GB of RAM (thanks to Amazon AWS). All the results are available, but you\\u2019ll need some serious hardware to redo the experiments! First off: which method did better? The image below summarizes the results from 501 iterations of random search and 402 of Bayesian optimization (called opt in the dataframe): Going by max score, random search does slightly better but if we measure by average score, bayesian optimization wins. The good news is this is almost exactly what we expect: random search can happen upon a great set of values because it thoroughly explores the search space, but Bayesian optimization will \\u201cfocus\\u201d on the highest scoring hyperparameter values by reasoning from previous results. Let\\u2019s take a look at a very revealing plot, the value of the cross validation score versus the number of iterations: We see absolutely no trend for random search, while Bayesian Optimization (again shown by opt ) improves over the trials. If you can understand this graph, then you can see the benefits of both methods: random search explores the search domain but Bayesian optimization gets better over time. We can also see that Bayesian optimization appears to reach a plateau, indicating diminishing returns to further trials. Second major question: what were the best hyperparameter values? Below are the optimal results from Bayesian optimization: We can use these results to build a model and submit predictions to the competition, or they can be used to inform further searches by allowing us to define a concentrated search space around the best values. One interesting aspect to consider is the values tried by each search method for each hyperparameter. The plots below show kernel density estimate (KDE) functions for each of the search methods as well as the sampling distribution (the hyperparameter grid). The dashed vertical lines indicate the optimal value found for each method. First is the learning rate: Even though the learning rate distribution stretched over several orders of magnitude, both methods found optimal values quite low in the domain. We can use this knowledge to inform further hyperparameter searches by concentrating our search in this region. In most cases, a lower learning rate increases the cross validation performance but at the cost of increased run-time, which is a trade-off we have to make. Let\\u2019s look at some other graphs. For most of the hyperparameters, the optimal values from both methods are fairly close, but not for colsample_bytree : This refers to the fraction of columns used when building each tree in the GBM, and random search found the optimal value was higher than Bayesian optimization. Again, these results can be used for further searches, as we see that the Bayesian method tended to concentrate on values around 0.65. We\\u2019ll show two more plots from this analysis because they are fairly interesting, involving two regularization parameters: What\\u2019s noteworthy here is that these two hyperparameters appear to be complements of one another: if one regularization value is high, then we want the other to be low and vice versa. Maybe this helps the model achieve a balance between bias/variance, the most common issue in machine learning. While random search does not change the distribution of values over the search, Bayesian optimization does, by concentrating on where it thinks the best values are in the search domain. We can see this by graphing the hyperparameter values against the iteration: The hyperparameters with the clearest trend are colsample_bytree and learning_rate which both continue downward over the trials. The reg_lambda and reg_alpha are diverging, which confirms our earlier hypothesis that we should decrease one of these while increasing the other. We want to be careful about placing too much value in these results, because the Bayesian optimization might have found a local minimum of the cross validation loss that it is exploiting. The trends here are pretty small, but it\\u2019s encouraging that the best value was found close to the end of the search indicating cross validation scores were continuing to improve. These next plots show the value of a single hyperparameter versus the score. We want to avoid placing too much emphasis on these graphs because we are not changing one hyperparameter at a time and there can be complex interactions between multiple hyperparameters. A truly accurate graph would be 10-dimensional and show the values of all hyperparameters and the resulting score. If we could understand a 10-dimensional graph, then we might be able to figure out the optimal combination of hyperparameters! Here the random search is in blue and the Bayesian in green: The only clear distinction is that the score decreases as the learning rate increases. We cannot say whether that is due to the learning rate itself, or some other factor (we will look at the interplay between the learning rate and the number of estimators shortly). There are not any strong trends here. The score versus subsample is a little off because boosting_type = 'goss' cannot use subsample (it must be set equal to 1.0). While we can\\u2019t look at all 10 hyperparameters at one time, we can view two at once if we turn to 3D plots! To try and examine the simultaneous effects of hyperparameters, we can make 3D plots with 2 hyperparameters and the score. A truly accurate plot would be 10-D (one for each hyperparameter) but in this case we will stick to 3 dimensions. (See the code for details, 3D plotting in Python is surprisingly straightforward). First we can show the reg_alpha and reg_lambda , the regularization hyperparameters versus the score (for Bayesian opt): It\\u2019s a little hard to make sense, but if we remember the best scores occurred around 0.5 for reg_alpha and 0.4 for reg_lambda , we can see generally better scores in this region. Next is the learning_rate and n_estimators (number of decision trees trained in the ensemble). While the learning rate was a hyperparameter in the grid, the number of decision trees (also called the number of boosting rounds) was found by early stopping with 5-fold cross validation: This time there is a clear trend: a lower learning rate and higher number of estimators increases the score. The relationship is expected because a lower learning rate means the contribution of each tree is reduced which necessitates training more trees. The expanded number of trees increases the model\\u2019s capacity to fit the training data (while also increasing the time to run). Moreover, as long as we use early stopping with enough folds, we don\\u2019t have to be concerned about overfitting with more trees. It\\u2019s nice when the results agree with our understanding (although we probably learn more when they don\\u2019t agree!) For the final plot, I wanted to show the correlations between each hyperparameter and each other and the score. These plots can\\u2019t prove causation, but they can tell us which variables are correlated: We already found most of the information from the graphs, but we can see the negative correlation between the learning rate and the score, and the positive correlation between the number of estimators and the score. The final step of the exploration was to implement both the random search best hyperparameters and the Bayesian optimization best hyperparameters on a full dataset (the dataset comes from this kernel and I would like to thank the author for making it public). We train the model, make predictions on the testing set, and finally upload to the competition to see how we do on the public leaderboard. After all the hard work, do the results hold up? If we go by best score on the public leaderboard, Bayesian Optimization wins! However, the public leaderboard is based only on 10% of the test data, so it\\u2019s possible this is a result of overfitting to this particular subset of the testing data. Overall, I would say the complete results \\u2014 including cross validation and public leaderboard \\u2014 suggest that both methods produce similar outcomes when run for enough iterations. All we can say for sure is that either method is better than hand-tuning! Our final model is enough to move us 1000 places up the leaderboard compared to our previous work. Finally, to end with one more plot, we can take a look at the feature importances from the trained GBM: NEW_CREDIT_TO_ANNUITY_RATIO and NEW_EXT_SOURCES_MEAN were features derived by the data science community on Kaggle and not in the original data. It\\u2019s reassuring to see these so high up in the importance because it shows the value of feature engineering. The major takeaways from this work are: Where to go from here? Well, there are always plenty of other methods to try such as automated feature engineering or treating the problem as a time-series. I\\u2019ve already done a notebook on automated feature engineering so that will probably be where my focus will turn next. We can also try other models or even journey into the realm of deep learning! I\\u2019m open to suggestions, so let me know on Kaggle or on Twitter. Thanks for reading, and if you want to check out any of my other work on this problem, here are the complete set of notebooks: There should be enough content there to keep anyone busy for a little bit. Now it\\u2019s off to do more learning/exploration for the next post! The best part about data science is that you\\u2019re constantly on the move, looking for the next technique to conquer. Whenever I find out what that is, I\\u2019ll be sure to share it! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

All code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an applied setting. This version of the Exploratory Data Analysis project has all the code removed for readability. The version with all the R code included is also on Medium. Doctor\\u2019s appointment no-shows are a serious issue in the public health care field. Missed appointments are associated with poorer patient outcomes and cost the health care system in the US nearly $200 each. Therefore, it comes as no small surprise that reducing the rate of no-shows has become a priority in the United States and around the world. Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to determine the most effective means of\\nreducing rates of absenteeism at with varying degrees of success. The first step to solving the problem of missed appointments is identifying why a patient skips a scheduled visit in the first place. What trends are there among patients with higher absence rates? Are there demographic indicators or perhaps time-variant relationships hiding in the data? Ultimately, it was these questions that drove my exploratory data analysis. I was curious as to the reasons behind missed appointments, and wanted to examine the data to identify any trends present. I choose this problem because I believe it is an excellent example of how data science and analysis can reveal relationships which can be implemented in the real-world to the benefit of society. I wanted to choose a dataset that was both relatable and could be used to make smarter decisions. Therefore, I decided to work with medical appointment no shows data available on Kaggle. This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit. There were a total of 14 variables I included from the original data. The variables and the description of the values are as follows Let\\u2019s take a look at the structure of the dataframe to identify cleaning/organizing that may need to be performed. From the structure of the dataframe, I can see there is some data housekeeping that needs to be done. First, I want to change the Status variable into an integer 0 or 1. A value of 1 will indicate that the patient did not show up as I am concerned with the variables that are most strongly correlated with a missed appointment. Moreover, I need to convert the registration date and the appointment date to date objects. I decided not to maintain the time (hours:minutes:seconds) associated with the registration date for the appointment although it was available (time of day was not available for the appointment date). I converted both the appointment registration date and appointment date to date objects so I could investigate seasonal and time patterns in the data. Based on the updated structure of the dataframe, it looks like I am on the right track but I still have a couple more modifications to make to the dataframe. I will create month, year, and day fields for the appointment and also rename the columns to a more consistent and readable format. That should about do it for the structure of the main dataframe. I am also concerned with missing/corrupted data, so I will look at the summary of each field to see if any obvious errors or outliers are present in the data. The summary of the no_shows dataframe reveals plenty of intriguing information as well as several errors that need to be corrected. Right away, it is clear that an age of -2 is not correct, and 113 is stretching the boundaries. However, looking at the oldest people in the world, it is plausible that 113 could be a correct age. I will filter out any negative ages and create a histogram of ages to see if there are a significant amount of outliers at the upper end. Moreover, this data summary shows that 30.24% of appointments are missed based on the mean for the status field. The rates for the various patient conditions can also be seen, and the most commonly coded reason for an appointment is hypertension at nearly 22% of visits. Also, the weekends appear to be a very unpopular time for doctor\\u2019s appointments in Brazil, or perhaps the clinics from which this data was drawn are not open on the weekend. Either way, I will need to keep the small sample size of appointments on the weekend in mind when I perform an analysis by weekday. Frequency Distribution of Ages The age histogram does not aligh exactly with my intutions though it is close. I expected that it would be bi-modal, with peaks in patient count at the youngest ages and at the oldest ages. However, while the largest number of patients do appear to be the youngest, the number of patients remains fairly constant into the middle ages, with a second peak around age 60 and then a steep decline into the oldest ages. Based on the visualization, there do not appear to be a large number of outliers in the upper range of the ages. I was skeptical of the high proportion of visits from those aged 0 and decided I needed to do some research. Based on the description of the dataset, this data is for primary care physicians in the public sector and so I looked for a breakdown of ages of patients at these appointments. I could not find statistics from Brazil, but based on official statistics from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, children under 1 year of age make up 2.6% of all physician visits. I can create a better plot showing the percentage each age is of all patients. I can also quickly check the percentage of visits comprised of patients aged 0 in the data. Percentage of patients with an age of 0:\\n3.442069% The calculation shows that 0-year olds make up 3.44% of visits. While the initial frequency distribution may looked skewed, the spread of the data along the years makes it look like 0-year olds make up considerably more of the visits than is actually the case. The corrected bar plot does a better job of representing the proportion of patients from each age. From the research by the CDC and the visualization, I conclude that the age distribution skew is not bad but rather legitimate data. To check for outliers in the waiting time field (or how long between the date the appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment), I will make another histogram. Based on the summary statistics of the dataframe, the longest waiting time was 398 days, with a median of 8 days, and a mean of 13.84 days. From the histogram and the statistics, it is clear that there are a small number of patients at the upper end of the distribution who schedule their appointment very far in advance. I wonder if the 398 days is accidentally a mistake that occured when someone choose the wrong year for their appointment! The graph is certainly long-tailed and positively skewed with a few extreme outliers at the upper limit. Number of patients with wait time longer than one year:\\n1\\nNumber of patients with wait time longer than six months:\\n136 It appears there is only one patient with a waiting time over one year and just over 100 (out of 300000) with a waiting time of over six months. I will exclude the patient with the waiting time over one year, but I will treat the others as good but extreme data. Here is a version of the histogram that better represents the wait time for most patients. As can be seen in the chart, a plurality of patients wait less than 10 days between the scheduling and the date of their appointment. Based on these visualizations, and the summary statistics for the dataframe, I am confident that the data content of the main dataframe is valid. I can now start the exploration phase of exploratory data analysis! It is time to discover the relationships, or lack thereof, between the variables in the data. The first step I can take is to find the correlations between all of the columns to see if any stand out as particularly compelling. Of course, I expect that all the trends will not reveal themselves straight away. The rcorr function from the Hmisc library will calculate the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coeffient between every field of a dataframe. The Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of how linearly dependent two variables on each other. The coefficient value is between -1 and +1, and two variables that are perfectly linearly correlated will have a value of +1. From those correlation values, there are no standouts that are strong linear predictors of whether or not a patient will miss a visit (given by the status column). It appears that there are not even any strong relationships whatsoever though there is a moderate relationship between age and hypertension. However, I still think there are meaningful relationships to extract from the data. My approach will be to group the data by various fields and then determine if the average absence rate shows a relationship with the fields. The first group of variables I will look at will be those associated with the time-variability of the appointment date. Date of Appointment To start off the time-series analysis, I will want to look at absence rate by month of the year. I first needed to group the appointments by month of year and then find the average absence rate for each month. From the graph and the correlation coefficient, it appears there is a minor relationship between month of the year and absence rate. Missed visits do appear to rise as the year progresses, but with only 12 data points, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient is quite large (-0.05 to 0.85). I would expect that during the end of the year, people tend to be busier and may miss more appointments. It could also be possible that at the beginning of the year, individuals make resolutions to see the doctor and keep a higher percentage of appointments, but the trend could also be noise. Next, I will create a similar absence rate over time graph, but this time by day of the month. Looking at the plot we can see that there is a very slight positive correlation between day of the month and absence rate but again, the 95% confidence interval spans a wide range of values. To further explore any time variability in the data, I can create the same graph by day of the year and broken out by gender. Mean absence rate for males:\\n30.99653%\\nMean absence rate for females\\n29.86962% From these charts, it appears looks as if there is no correlation betwen the time of year and the absence rate for appointments. Moreover, adding in the gender does not reveal any major descrepancies, although from the calculation, we can see that men on average have a 1% higher absence rate. There are several days for which the absence rate is 1, which bears some more investigation. My idea is that these points might corespond to public holidays. However, I also see that these days are not consistent across the two years, so maybe there are other major events that correspond to an increase in absences. I decided to overlay the holidays to see if that might reveal a relationship. I sourced the holidays based on public holidays in Brazil for each respective year. Again, it seems as if these holidays do not line up with higher rates of missed appointments. There is a sustained increase in the absence rate around the beginning of July, but it does not seem to correspond to any holidays. I researched festivals in Brazil in June-July 2015, and it appears that the Paraty International Literary Festival occured July 1\\u20135, but I doubt that this explains the absence rate. There was not city data associated with the original dataset, so it is difficult to attempt to cross-reference specific dates with specific events.\\nI will create a simliar graph for 2014. I remember that the 2014 soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, so perhaps the time around the world cup will have a higher absence rate. I will plot a few holidays and then the dates surrounding the World Cup (which lasted for a month). Perhaps there is a slight increase in absence rate during the World Cup? The graph does not clearly indicate either was but I can compare the average absence rate during the World Cup to the average absence rate over the entire length of 2014.Mean absence rate during all of 2014\\\\ [1] 30.08656\\nMean absence rate during 2014 World Cup\\n[1] 30.79473 There is a small but not significant increase in the absence rate during the World Cup. It looks like in terms of time variability, there is no significant correlation based on the day of the year or the day of the month. There is one more time variation I want to look at, and that is day of the week. To remind myself of the small sample sizes on the weekend, I also show the appointment days of the week count. Finally, it looks like there might be some time variability in this data when it is broken down by weekday. Excluding Saturday and Sunday because of their small sample sizes, Monday and Friday have the highest absence rate and Tuesday has the lowest. I will alter the plot to show the absence rate as a relative percentage change from the overall mean absence rate. Based on this chart, patients are 6% more likely to miss an appointment on a Monday compared to the overall average absence rate, and 4% less likely to miss an appointment on a Tuesday. This is an actionable discovery for both patients and doctors! If patients want to keep their appointments, and if doctors want to make sure their patients show up, they should schedule their appointments during the middle three days of the week. Patient Age I wanted to move on from the time variability and look at the demographic data. In particular, I am interested in whether or not age is correlated with absence rate. My initial guess would be that the youngest and the oldest patients would tend to have lower absence rates. Meanwhile, those patients in the middle would generally be healthier and thus would feel more inclined to skip an appointment. (Everyone is convinced they are invincible in their 20s. In fact, this was one of the issues associated with the initial rollout of Obamacare. Too many young, healthy individuals did not believe they needed insurance and therefore did not sign up for healthcare.) First I will group patients by age and then visualize the average absence rates. The chart reveals the possibility of a negative relationship between age and absence rate. First though, it is clear that the outliers in the upper end of the data introduce substantial variance. As there are only 719 patients over 90 out of 300000 entries, I think I can filter out any ages over 90 without impacting the validating of the data while reducing the noise. I will use that filter and then improve the aesthetics of the graph. We can observe that the youngest ages have a relatively low absence rate with an exception for 1-year-olds. The absence rate then climbs for teenagers, peaking around age 20, before beginning a long, gradual decline to around 70, at which point the absence rate rises again slightly. I would like to know precisely which ages have the highest and lowest absence rates. Moreover, what is the pearson correlation between age and absence rate? Maximum absence rate of 40.21% occurs at age 18\\nMinimum absence rate of 20.25% occurs at age 72 Here are more actionable conclusions. Public health officials need to work on getting teenagers to show up to their appointments! This is expecially crucial because studies have shown that habits form very early and are hard to change later in life. A trend of going to the doctor while younger will likely persist as a patient ages and lead to better lifelong health. We can further bin the data in five years increments to highlight the \\u201cproblem years\\u201d, that is, the years with the highest missed appointment rate. I will plot the relative absence rate, or the average age group absence rate as a percentage relative to the average absence rate for all ages. Remember, in this plot, below the x-axis is better because it indicates that the age group has a lower rate of missed appointments than the average. Based on the chart, is it clear that the worst group in terms of absence rate is 15\\u201320 year-olds and the best group for attedance is 70\\u201375 year-olds. The visualization and the statistics are definitive when it comes to ages and missed appointments. The correlation between ages and absence rate is -0.86, which is strongly negative and indicates that as the age of the patient increases, statistically, that patient is less likely to miss a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. Waiting Time After finding a strong relationship between age and absence rate, I will move on to examine other variables. I would like to search for a possible trend in absence rate by waiting time, or the time between when an appointment was scheduled, and when the appointment took place. My hypothesis is that patients with a longer waiting time will have a higher missed appointment rate because their condition has more time to change in the interim period. Moreover, I think that patients with a shorter waiting time are more likely to need urgent care or have a problem they deem to be pressing, and it would certainly be in their best interest to show up at the appointment. The graph and the correlation coefficient seem to demonstrate a lack of any relationship. However, thinking back on the histogram of waiting time from the initial exploration, the majority of the patients waited under 100 days. There are far fewer data points from people waiting more than 100 days, which is why the average absence rate for those times tends to be either 0% or 100%. If I limit the data to people with a waiting time less than 3 months (90 days), might there exist a relationship? Furthermore, I will group the data into 10 day segments. Patients with a waiting time over 90 days\\n1646 If the data is limited to those patients who scheduled fewer than 3 months in advance, there is a slight positive correlation between waiting time and absence rate. I tried to do some research on this subject in general, and found this from the Safety Net Dental Clinic: \\u201cExperience in many safety net dental programs also suggests that the incidence of broken appointments increases when appointments are scheduled more than three weeks in advance.\\u201d Based on my analysis, I concur. Patients who schedule less than 10 days out are 20% less likely to miss an appointment than those scheduling further out. The Safety Net Dental Clinic page mentions that often other life events get in the way when we schedule too far out, and although that may be a slightly different situation, the general pattern appears to hold in this case. Add a point to schedule as few days out as possible to the list of recommendations for patients looking to adhere to a scheduled appointment. SMS Reminders One of the most intriguing aspects of the dataset to me was the SMS (Short Message Service) text message reminder counts. Text message reminders have been implemented in many clinics because of their ease of use and low cost. Moreover, they have been shown to be effective in some situations. I want to examine this data to discover how or if SMS messages correlate with a failure to attend. I would think that patients who recieve SMS messages will be more likely to attend the appointment than those not receiving them. However, this could be complicated by the fact that younger patients are more likely to sign up for text message alerts, and as we have already seen, young individuals are more inclined to be record a no-show. Therefore, I will probably need to further look at who exactly is recieving the text messages in addition to the correlation between text messages and attendance at the appointment. The graph is somewhat surprising to me; one text message seems to decrease the absence rate while two increases the absence rate significantly. I would have expected more SMS reminders to be strongly correlated with a decrease in absence rate. Maybe the direction of this relationship is the opposite of what I thought. Instead of SMS messages persuading patients to attend a scheduled appointment, patients who are least likely to attend an appointment receive more text messages. One way to check for this would be to look at average SMS messages per appointment received by age. I expect there might be odd behavior at the ends of this graph (how young do children receive their first phone nowadays? Has the average 80-year old embraced text messages?). I expect that segmenting by age might reveal more nuances than the overall absence rate vs text messages. Sure enough, the average number of SMS reminders per appointment is greater among the younger ages. I looked through the data provider information, and I could not ascertain whether or not those SMS reminders were to the parent in the case of a very young child but that seems likely. From the statistics and the plot, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of SMS messages and the age of the patient. To further explore the absence rate vs text message, I will recreate the absence rate vs age graph, but this time, create separate curves for number of SMS reminders received. Looking at the graph, we can see that the absence rate versus age grouped by number of SMS reminders looks much the same for the 0 or 1 reminders. However, the graph for 2 reminders is much noisier. I suspect that is due to the lower sample size of people receiving two reminders (which was the maximum). In order to determine if there is an effect from text message reminders at a given age, I need to create a plot showing the difference in absence rates at each age between those receiving any reminder and those receiving no reminder. Indeed, it does appears that at a given age, the absence rate decreases with 1 or 2 text messages reminders. In fact, the average difference in absence rate holding age constant is -0.57%. That means that having receiving an SMS reminder at a given age decreases the chance that a patient will miss a scheduled appointment by 0.6%. This may seem small, but it could add up over millions of appointments. Moreover, there are certain ages when the effect of the SMS reminders is much greater. The reduction in missed appointments is as great as 2% at age ten and near 3% during other years. This reduction in the failure to attend rate is also what research into text message reminders has found. One study,conducted in Brazil, found: \\u201cThe nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p = .590), 3.55% (p = .009), 5.75% (p = .022), and 14.49% (p = <.001).\\u201d Furthermore, the conclusion of this research was: \\u201cThe study results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients\\u2019 cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving uninterrupted care benefit.\\u201d Based on my analysis of the data, I must concur that at a given age, SMS reminders decrease the absence rate. Another valuable piece of information that could be quite easily implemented in the real world to improve outcomes! Patient Markers The final step in this exploratory analysis is to look at the absence rate by the condition for which the patient visited the doctor. I will group by the markers in the original data and then look at each average absence rate. There are considerable differences illustrated between those with different markers. Tuberculosis has the highest rate of absence, followed by alcoholism. However, these conditions also make up a small sample of the overall visits. Diabetes and hypertension have the lowest absence rate. Interestingly, patients marked as being part of the Bolsa Familia welfare program have a high rate of absences. This program rewards patients for attending appointments, which should induce patients to visit their doctor more often. Perhaps there are other factors at play here though. It could be that families on the welfare program cannot take the time to visit the doctor because of the opportunity cost of not working. To put the conditions in perspective, here is the percentage of all visits each condition makes up. The final plot I can make is of the conditions and the relative percentage difference in absence rates compared to the mean absence rate. Relative difference plots are helpful to me because it is possible to quickly identify if one variable is above or below the average. Again, for this particular plot, values below the x-axis are great because it means the absence rate is lower than the overall average. The differences between conditions here are stark. Again, the smaller sample sizes associated with alcoholism and tuberculosis must be taken into account, but it is clear that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to attend an appointment. In fact, they are more than 15% less likely to miss an appointment then the average patient. This is an interesting result and I wonder if it is because of the constant need for care when treating both of these conditions. However, it would seem like all of the conditions require care on an ongoing basis. I would need more detailed condition information before I drew any conclusions about possible causes of the absence rates broken out by condition. I started this project off with a single simple question: what factors are most likely to determine whether or not a patient shows up to their scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment? As the exploratory data analysis went on, I found this one question had branched into dozens. Does the number of SMS reminders correlate with absence rates? How about if we compare SMS reminders for a given age? Are there major variabilities that we can observe associated with holidays? I found my curiousity and interest in the dataset only grew as I delved further and further. Although at first it appeared there were few meaningful relationships, by grouping and segmenting the data, clear trends emerged. Keeping in mind that this dataset may not be representative of all countries and health care systems, the following are the most notable discoveries from the patient no-show data: 2. There is a slight positive correlation between absence rate and the day of the month and as the month progresses, the percentage of missed appointments rises moderately. 3. There is no correlation in the absence rate over the days of the year. 4. Excluding the weekends, the day of the week with the highest absence rate is Monday followed by Friday. Tuesday had the lowest rate of absences with appointments on Tuesday 4% more likely to be attended than those on the other days of the week. 5. The age of patients was demonstrated a strong negative linear correlation with absence rates with a correlation coefficient of -0.86. 6. There was a slight positive correlation between the rate of missed appointments and how many days in advance the patient scheduled the appointment. 7. When looking at the dataset as a whole, patients who recieved two SMS reminders were more likely to miss an appointment than those who recieved no reminders. However, the correlation between age and average text messages recieved was -0.80 meaning that younger patients, who were more likely to miss appointments overall, received more text messages. Subsequently, the effect of text messages reminders can only be revealed by looking at messages received at a given age. 8. Patients whose appointments were marked for tuberculosis and alcoholism were the most likely to miss the visit, while those coded for hypertension and diabetes were the least likely to miss their appointment. These are but a few briefs observations that can be gleaned from this dataset. Keeping in mind that correlations do not imply causations (more serious link for those interested), and that some of the groupings results in small sample sizes, there are actionable items that with appropriate further study, could be implemented in the health care system. The final aspect of the project was to revisit and refine three of my earlier plots. Primarily I am concerned with whether or not the visualizations correctly convey the information within the dataset. My secondary objective is of course aesthetics because what good is even the most informative chart if it is not presentable? Absence Rate vs. Day of the Year This first chart was notable to me because of the lack of relationships it revealed. It is the graph of absence rate versus day of the year in 2014 with holidays (and the World Cup) included. I would have initially believed that absence rates spiked around holidays and near the end of the year. However, no clear trend emerged from this plot. In order to improve the information content and the aesthetics, I altered some of the colors, changed the scale on the axis, added in the mean absence rate for reference, and made sure all labels were accurate. The conclusion to draw from this visualization is that there is no trend in rate of missed appointments over the year by day. Even on major public holidays (of which the World Cup may be the greatest!) there is no noticeable change in absence rate around or on the holiday. This was backed up by the correlation coefficient which showed no linear relationship between day of year and the failure to attend statistic. The overall mean, plotted as the horizontal black line, shows the absence rate for all patients was 30.24%. Women on average had a slightly lower rate of 29.87% and men had a slightly higher rate at 31.00%. The gender discrepancy can barely be picked out on the graph, but it is present. Absence Rate vs. Age by SMS Reminders The second crucial visualization is the absence rate versus age broken down by number of SMS reminders. When I initially looked at the data showing that overall, people who received 2 text message reminders had higher absences rates, I was a little skeptical. However, after some thought, I realized that people who received text messages were likely to be younger, and I had seen that the younger the patient, the higher the absence rate. Therefore, I decided to look at the effect of text messages reminders at each given age. Based on the resulting chart, I saw that indeed, SMS reminders do reduce the absence rate at a specific age. To make the point clearer in the plot below, I plotted the average absence rate vs age for those who received no text reminders and for those who received either 1 or 2 reminders. The original graph was very noisy, so I applied a moving average over 5 years. The 5 year window was a selection based on the bias-variance tradeoff because while I wanted a smoother plot, I did not want to introduce a high amount of bias into the averages. After improving the graph, it is possible to observe the trend of fewer absences at older ages and the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing the failure to attend rate. The main two takeaways from this visualization are that as age increases, the absence rate decreases, and, at a given age, patients who receive at least one SMS reminder miss fewer appointments. The age distribution of missed appointments was in line with what I had expected, although I would have initially guessed that children under 10 would have the low absence rates comparable to what was observed in those aged 40 and over. It was not surprising to me that patients in their teens and early 20s had the highest failure to attend rate and it is clear that more effort needs to be expended in ensuring that this age group shows up for their appointments. This is one application where text message reminders could be most useful. Looking at the chart, it is also possible to observe that the rate of no-shows for those receiving an SMS reminder is lower than that for those recieving no reminder at almost every age. Overall, for a given age, text message reminders resulted in absence rates 0.5% lower which could make a substantial impact on the scale on a national health care system. Absence Rate vs. Waiting Time The third vital graph from this analysis was the relative absence rate vs waiting time graph. This graph displays the absence rate relative the overall mean absence rate for patient groups based on how far in advance they scheduled their appointment. I initially grouped the waiting time, or the elasped days between when the appointment was made and when the appointment occurred, by groups of five days. I then plotted the relative absence rate compared to the overall average for each group. I was surprised to discover how much lower the absence rate was for those sceduling less than 10 days in advance. To improve the plot, I increased the resolution of the graph by narrowing the bin widths to groups of 3 days. I also decided to add in a model created with the LOESS, Local Regression, method of regression. I created a simple model and then used the prediction it generated for each age grouping to draw a curve. The graph reveals the crucial information that appointments scheduled shorter out tend to have higher attendance rates. The actionable takeaway for patients from this graph is to schedule appointments on a shorter time scale, preferentially less than 10 days in advance. The absence rate for those whose appointments were scheduled only 3 days or less in advance was nearly 30% lower relative to the overall absence rate. Moreover, the model shows that the trend in increasing absence rate with longer waiting times is nearly linear for the first month. After that point, the noise in the visualization increases, but the majority of groups with wait times over 12 days had a higher absence rate than the mean. Patients would be wise to schedule their appointments as soon as possible in order to follow through on visiting the doctor. Taken together, these three visualizations illustrate several pieces of advice for patients and doctors who have a mutal interest in driving the absence rate as low as possible:\\n1. Day of the year does not affect the absence rate even near the holidays.\\n2. Young adults are the most likely to miss their appointments and therefore will need extra prodding to attend an appointment. This prodding can come in the form of SMS reminders, which reduce the absence rate for a given age.\\n3. Patients should schedule appointments as few days in advance as possible. Ideally appointments would occur within 9 days of being scheduled to increase the chance of attendance. The primary reason I wanted to learn the tools of data analysis was in order to could extract meaningful information from the mounds of data generated in our modern world. I want to be able to take hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points and extract insights which can be implemented in the real world to improve human institutions, such as the medical system. Exploring the patient no-show dataset has been a small step towards developing that ability. Although the sheer amount of data appeared overwhelming at first, and there were no correlations that immediately stood out, by selectively grouping the data and adjusting the visualization parameters, I was able to discover several key relationships.\\nThe main difficulty I had was beginning the analysis. With so many variables, it was a struggle to decide where I should first concentrate. However, once I started grouping the data, I found more and more directions I could explore until I felt that I was satisfied with the extent to which I had unraveled the data. The trends and patterns in the datadictate the questions that we should ask of it. R is a tricky language to pick up, but once I understood the patterns and syntax, I enjoyed the level of control it gave me over the visualizations. I was frustrated at times trying to perfect parameters of a graph, but in the end, I think I am a better data analyst because I had to work through all the intricacies of the R language. The next step forward, now that the exploratory data analysis of the no-shows dataset is complete, is to perform confirmatory data analysis. Based on my initial observations, I could form several hypotheses and then use rigorous statistical methods to test those hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis can discover potential relationships, but it takes statistical testing to determine whether these correlations are statistically meaningful. Moreover, this dataset is an ideal candidate for using machine learning to create classifiers that would identify patients likely to be a no-show at an appointment. The objective would be to make a model that would take in as features patient demographics and conditions, and would return the likelihood that a patient would fail to attend a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. If the model was accurate enough, it could then be implemented in the real-world by ensuring that patients most likely to miss a doctor\\u2019s visit receive additional persuasion. Moreover, with a more complete dataset, including city information or detailed demographics, more relationships could be discovered such as absence rate correlations with the weather or with access to public transportation. The initial exploratory data analysis of the doctor\\u2019s appointment no-show data has revealed numerous potential relationships. The dataset holds actionable information and this project demonstrates the benefits of not just collecting large amounts of data, but thoroughly analyzing it to find the correlations that could be used to improve patient outcomes and public health. Originally published at medium.com on August 8, 2017.\",\n          \"In his sweeping 2011 work The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined, Steven Pinker makes the audacious claim, \\u201ctoday we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species\\u2019 existence.\\u201d To someone who pays even a little attention to constant news reports of violence, both local and international, this statement sounds ludicrous. The grandeur of this assertion should immediately raise our suspicions; as the science popularizer Carl Sagan often said, \\u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\\u201d Does Pinker have that evidence and does he interpret it correctly? Over the course of 800 pages, Pinker makes a convincing argument with numbers, figures, and references to many books and articles. Nonetheless, it\\u2019s critical that we don\\u2019t rely on a single argument to form our worldview. We must remember that data is never objective, and therefore we need to look at the data itself as well as multiple expert interpretations. In this article, we\\u2019ll examine the global violent conflict data and different stances on the same numbers. (As a note, Pinker\\u2019s work deals with all forms of violence from the individual \\u2014 homicides, abuse \\u2014 to the worldwide, but here we\\u2019ll focus on international violent conflicts \\u2014 war \\u2014 and leave the rest for future articles). This is Episode 2 of the Reality Project, an endeavor with the aim of becoming less wrong about the world with data. You can find all the articles here. (I\\u2019d like to emphasize I\\u2019m not trying to minimize the atrocities of war by presenting only data. It can be easy to lose track that we are talking about people when looking at numbers and every loss of human life is a tragedy.) Our primary sources of derived data on the more positive side will be The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker and the \\u201cWar and Peace\\u201d page on Our World in Data. For a contrasting viewpoint, we\\u2019ll use \\u201cSteven Pinker is Wrong\\u201d by John Gray and \\u201cThe Decline of Conflict: What Do the Data Really Say?\\u201d by Pasquale Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. You can find raw data for your own analysis at The Conflict Catalog or the World Bank. The first question we need to ask to assess violence today is how violent was the past. While extremely reliable data is difficult to come by, anthropologists use archaeological evidence to determine causes of death and therefore approximate the rates of violence in a society. These results are shown in the following graphs of percentages of deaths that come from violent conflict in prehistoric and non-state societies (from Our World in Data). The percentages of individuals killed by violence ranges from about 60% to less than 5% in both prehistoric and nonstate societies. Those numbers are almost meaningless until we put them in perspective with modern figures: The most relevant entries are the final two. The US and Europe from 1900\\u20131960, even with two world wars, saw less than 1% of their population perish in armed conflicts. In 2007, just 0.04% of deaths in the world were from international violence. If this data is correct, the world in 2007 was at least an order of magnitude safer than most prehistoric societies. We can also look at the same data in a slightly different manner, as the violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per year. Here we again see the same pattern of lower violence in modern times. On the left are non-state societies and on the right are state societies. Focusing on the bottom 3 rows of the right-hand table, we can see the strikingly low rates of violent death among modern societies, even accounting for two world wars. Again, it\\u2019s worth stressing the data here is not complete, but what is available suggests the following hypothesis: prehistoric and nonstate societies experienced much higher rates of violence than modern state societies. As Pinker and others (notably Jared Diamond) have made clear, the \\u201cnoble savage\\u201d idea is entirely false. People did not live peacefully with one another when they were organized in tribes and then become more violent as they were civilized, but the opposite: they were extremely violent in tribes and gradually became less so as larger civilizations were built and commerce started to connect the world (this highlights two of the drivers in the decline of global war \\u2014 trade and powerful states \\u2014 that we\\u2019ll look at shortly). Even accounting for the atrocities wrought by nation-states in the 20th century, rates of violent death appear to be lower now than at any previous point. It\\u2019s worth looking into the period of time for which we have the best data: the modern age. In particular, we\\u2019ll zoom in on the post-1945 era, a time that Pinker has classified as \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d. From this vantage point, things look very good. As noted by Pinker, since 1953, there have been zero conflicts between major world powers (the exception since WW2 was the Korean War) and there have been zero internationally recognized states that have gone out of existence through conquest since 1945. When we look at the data on battle deaths per 100,000 people in state-based conflicts, we see a significant decline since World War Two. Since the end of the second world war, the rate of deaths from all conflicts has decreased, with the most noticeable decline in conflicts between states. Most of the remaining battle deaths occur in civil conflicts, such as the tragic civil war in Syria that has been ongoing since 2011. Moreover, many of these civil wars involve foreign states, and the argument could be made major states have stopped fighting each other directly, but engage through other conflicts. One discouraging bit of news in contrast to the above graph is the number of overall state conflicts since the second world war: While the number of battle-related deaths (in the rate of people killed / 100,000 / year) has decreased, the total number of conflict is rising. This tells us that, contrary to what we might think as weapon technology advances, violent conflicts are resulting in fewer battle deaths. While, there are more civil conflicts around the globe, these tend to be less catastrophic than wars between major powers. Fortunately, the wars between major states have been on the decline \\u2014 even including the entire 20th century \\u2014 and show no signs of reversal. We can see this in the final chart of section showing the percent of the time major powers have been at war over the past 500 years (grouped into 25-year periods). There has been a clear decline in the percentage of years in which the major powers fought with one another since at least 1600. At one point the rate reached 100% \\u2014 indicating there was at least one conflict between world powers for the entire 25-year period. Contrast that with 2000, when there were 0 conflicts between world powers. The current period of 66 years without a conflict between major powers is the longest time since at least the Roman Empire. After an exploration of the data thus far, Pinker\\u2019s argument looks to be holding up: the rate of death in battle for modern state societies in war is much lower than prehistoric and non-state societies even accounting for the world wars. Furthermore, the major powers no longer fight one another and while the number of civil conflicts has increased, these result in fewer deaths than conflicts between major states. However, before we consider this case to be closed we need to talk about one fundamental issue. Consider the following two scenarios: Which is worse? The question depends on your observation point. On the ground, observing from the location of the conflict itself, the bar is much worse. An individual in the bar has a 1 in 2 chance of being killed. From an outsider\\u2019s vantage point the civil war is much worse with a total loss of life 10 times greater. This is one of the central arguments that Pinker\\u2019s critics make: measuring violence in rates ignores the absolute numbers which means it does not account for the actual amount of human suffering. One of Pinker\\u2019s harshest critics, Nassim Taleb, brings up the point of units in his response. He illustrates it with the following pair of plots: The graph on the left shows the raw number of casualties versus time for major conflicts. The graph on the right shows the rescaled version where the populations have been standardized across all times to have the same base population. As an example, if we have a population 100 society that suffers 2 deaths and a society with 1000 people that suffers 10, we would multiply 2 * 10 to get 20 deaths to account for the population difference. These figures encapsulate the rates/absolute numbers argument: the rates of death in violent conflicts have clearly been decreasing and are at a historical low, but the actual number of deaths has increased over time. Although, it\\u2019s worth pointing out the actual number has decreased since 1950. I don\\u2019t know if I have an answer for you on this problem of relative/absolute. As a utilitarian, I believe in bringing the greatest amount of total good to the greatest amount of people, and therefore, I see the total number of humans dead as the mark of how our civilization has failed. On the other side of the argument, a human alive today has less probability of being killed in a violent conflict than at any point in the past which is no doubt progress. I\\u2019ll let the facts stand and allow you to decide for yourself. Even if we don\\u2019t want to make a judgment on the overall outcome, it\\u2019s worth taking a look at the potential causes for the reduction in rates of violence. In particular, we might want to think about why the total number of deaths (in addition to the relative measures) have fallen since 1945. For this section, we will look at Steven Pinker\\u2019s ideas as outlined in The Better Angels of Our Nature. (This work is the best look at potential reasons why violence has declined \\u2014 partly because others refuse to concede this point). Pinker explains five forces, intended to account for the decline of violence on all scales, not just state-based conflicts, but we\\u2019ll focus on the first two which are most relevant to international conflict. The five historical forces behind the reduction in violence are: A powerful central government that can make and enforce laws using violence means that citizens are less likely to take punishment into their own hands, a concept known as the Leviathon theory. For all its romantic appeal, vigilante justice only leads to unending cycles of revenge violence. When citizens can count on a government to deliver fair punishments, they let the judicial system enforce the rules. Also, a state can prevent crime by making the penalty far greater than any potential payoff. Humans have the potential for both evil and good, and a strong central government with a fair criminal justice system with disincentives can steer them on the right path. A strong government alone is not enough for keeping the peace between nations though. On an international scale, the evidence suggests that democracies don\\u2019t fight each other possibly because of the ideals they share in common. Looking at some of the data, it\\u2019s clear that democracies just don\\u2019t fight one another directly anymore (although they may engage in proxy war). (For more on this concept see \\u201cDemocratic Peace Theory.\\u201d) The idea that one democratic nation will not fight another is good news as democracies on the rise in the long run worldwide as shown by Pinker: (One counterpoint is the recent decline in Democratic Index which measures not just the government but also freedom of the press and voting rights. Although the long-term trends are positive, the recent declines are worrying.) The theory of gentle commerce can be summed up in two statements: Why don\\u2019t you steal a loaf of bread from the grocery store? Although most people believe they don\\u2019t steal because it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do, the real reason is more mundane: in our society, the potential cost of getting caught stealing \\u2014 jail time and social ostracization \\u2014 are higher than the cost to purchase items. When people are provided a legal means to obtain their goods that is cheaper than violence, they will take the legal option. We explored the second point in \\u201cThe Disappearing Poor\\u201d, but it\\u2019s worth reiterating. Without exchanges in a market economy, all interactions between humans are zero-sum: you can steal something from me, but your gain is offset by my loss so humanity is no better off; the size of the economy stays the same. However, in an exchange of goods, both parties come out better ahead. Exchange also allows for specialization so different individuals/countries can make the goods for which they are best suited. Moreover, as trade continues, countries become dependent on one another because they no longer make all the goods they need. The end result of exchange is more plentiful goods at cheaper prices for all parties and improved international relations. Over the past several hundred years, we have slowly built up an international marketplace where all players are heavily dependent on one another. The US will not fight with another major power, not because she couldn\\u2019t defeat them, but because the economic losses would far outweigh the gains. As discussed by Pinker, countries that depend more on each other for trade are less likely to have a violent conflict controlling for other factors. In summary, the financial incentives have switched from war to trade for most nations. The Leviathon and gentle commerce actually work together \\u2014 a strong government is able to create markets that allow for safe exchanges and enforce laws regulating trade. In other words, once you have a strong state, trading is easier, and more trading between nations means they are less likely to attack one another. As trade between world powers has increased, conflicts between major powers has also decreased to 0 since 1953. There are doubtless other factors that have played a role in the decline of war between nations. We discussed external historical factors behind the decrease, but Pinker and others (John Horgan in The End of War) have also outlined internal factors, like The Better Angels of Our Nature : empathy, self-control, morals, reason. By examining the data and the reasons, it\\u2019s clear that the major powers no longer see war as a feasible choice. This is not necessarily because they are ethical, but because the economics of war no longer makes sense. At the end of the day, humans \\u2014 and nations \\u2014 are driven by incentives, and through international trade, we have built a world where the incentives favor peace. In a narrow point of view, Pinker is correct: rates of violent conflict have substantially decreased and there is reason to believe they are at the lowest point in human history (if only because data is limited). Also, at least among modern democracies, violence is no longer seen as the default option for solving problems as it has been for almost all of human history. That being said, it\\u2019s worth thinking about how Pinker\\u2019s argument made be misleading. The first point is that by focusing on rates rather than numbers, we are neglecting the actual human suffering. More people dying from war is more people dying from war even if the percentage is decreasing. The numbers can be used to support multiple conclusions depending on one\\u2019s argument. A second central issue is, especially for pre-historic societies, reliable data is hard to get. Most of the numbers for conflict rates and deaths in prehistoric societies come by examining archaeological sites and looking at artifacts for evidence of violent death. However, it could be possible these marks have been misinterpreted and anthropologists could not possibly have studied all prehistoric societies. Simple extrapolation what has been found is the only option, but it\\u2019s also important to not draw immature conclusions. The last major issue we\\u2019ll cover here (for more see Taleb\\u2019s article) is that we could be living in an anomalous age. Pinker calls the most recent 70 years of peace (no wars between modern nations), \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d, but it could be really only the temporary peace. Furthermore, as pointed out by Taleb, wars tend to be power law distributed, that is, they have long tails skewed to the right. The vast majority of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by a small number of the conflicts as can be seen below: One single conflict can completely outweigh all others in terms of deaths. Most of the armed conflicts since 1945 have fallen on the low end of the scale, but it only takes a single major battle to overshadow the peace since 1945. It\\u2019s possible a new conflict, one caused by global warming, resource shortages, or territorial disputes, could entirely undo the millennia of progress humans have made on violence reduction efforts. Initially, after reading Pinker\\u2019s book, I was convinced by his thesis. However, after taking the time to dig through the facts myself, a more nuanced picture emerged, one where sensationalist conflicts on both sides are not warranted. I see reasons for optimism: decreasing rates of deaths in armed conflicts mean a human alive today is less likely to die in battle than in recorded history, no battles between major powers since 1953, and a reduction in overall battle deaths since the 1950s, as well as reasons for pessimism: democracy and international trade, so important for reducing major conflicts, appear to be on a decline in recent years. Moreover, while major powers no longer fight directly with each other, they are involved through proxy wars. The exploration of violent conflict highlights the objective of the Reality Project. It\\u2019s not designed to be a feel-good effort but a fact-based endeavor, and, thus, any time I encounter an argument that is appealing to me this should only tell me to be more skeptical. The Reality Project has allegiances to no single interest, except getting at the actual statistics behind our world. It\\u2019s nice when the facts make us optimistic, but even when they don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s critical to understand the data so we can work to improve things. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

It\\u2019s a machine learning education disguised as a competition! Although there are valid criticisms of Kaggle, overall, it\\u2019s a great community that provides interesting problems, thousands of data scientists willing to share their knowledge, and an ideal environment for exploring new ideas. As evidence of this, I never would have learned about the Gradient Boosting Machine, or, one of the topics of this article, automated model optimization, were it not for the Kaggle Home Credit contest. In this article, part three of a series (Part One: Getting Started and Part Two: Improving) documenting my work for this contest, we will focus on a crucial aspect of the machine learning pipeline: model optimization through hyperparameter tuning. In the second article, we decided on the Gradient Boosting Machine as our model of choice, and now we have to get the most out of it through optimization. We\\u2019ll do this primarily with two methods: random search and automated tuning with Bayesian optimization. All the work presented here is available to run on Kaggle in the following notebooks. The article itself will highlight the key ideas but the code details are all in the notebooks (which are free to run with nothing to install!) For this article we will skip the background, so if at any time you feel lost, I encourage you to go to the previous articles and notebooks. All of the notebooks can be run on Kaggle without the need to download anything, so I highly recommend checking them out or competing! In the first part of this series, we got familiar with the dataset, performed exploratory data analysis, tried our hand at feature engineering, and built a few baseline models. Our public leaderboard score from this round was 0.678 (which at the moment would place us lower than 4000 on the leaderboard). Part two involved in-depth manual feature engineering, followed by feature selection and more modeling. Using the expanded (and then contracted) set of features, we ended up with a score of 0.779, quite an improvement from the baseline, but not quite in the top 50% of competitors. In this article, we will once again better our score and move up 1000 places on the leaderboard. Optimization in the context of machine learning means finding the set of model hyperparameter values that yield the highest cross validation score for a given dataset. Model hyperparameters, in contrast to model parameters that are learned during training, are set by the data scientist before training. The number of layers in a deep neural network is a model hyperparameter while the splits in a decision tree are model parameters. I like to think of model hyperparameters as settings that we need to tune for a dataset: the ideal combination of values is different for every problem! There are a handful of ways to tune a machine learning model: These are presented in order of increasing efficiency, with manual search taking the most time (and often yielding the poorest results) and automated methods converging on the best values the quickest, although, as with many topics in machine learning, this is not always the case! As shown in this great paper, random search does surprisingly well (which we\\u2019ll see shortly). (There are also other hyperparameter tuning methods such as evolutionary and gradient-based. There are constantly better methods being developed, so make sure to stay up to date on the current best practice!) In the second part of this series, we decided to use the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model because of its superior performance on structured data with many features. The GBM is extremely powerful (yet easy to implement in Python), but it has dozens of hyperparameters that significantly affect performance and which must be optimized for a problem. If you want to feel overwhelmed, check out the documentation on the LightGBM library: I don\\u2019t think there is anyone in the world who can look at all of these and pick the best values! Therefore, we need to implement one of the four methods for choosing the hyperparameters. For this problem, I didn\\u2019t even try manual tuning, both because this was my first time working with the GBM and because I didn\\u2019t want to waste any time. e\\u2019ll skip straight to random search and automated techniques using Bayesian optimization. In the first notebook, we go through an implementation of grid and random search covering the four parts of an optimization problem: These four parts also form the basis of Bayesian optimization, so laying them out here will help when it comes to that implementation. For the code details, refer to the notebooks, but here we\\u2019ll briefly touch on each concept. The objective function takes in a set of inputs and returns a score that we want to maximize. In this case, the inputs are the model hyperparameters, and the score is the 5-fold cross validation ROC AUC on the training data. The objective function in pseudo-code is: The goal of hyperparameter optimization is to find the hyperparameters that return the best value when passed into the objective function. That seems pretty simple, but the problem is evaluating the objective function is very expensive in terms of time and computational resources. We cannot try every combination of hyperparameter values because we have a limited amount of time, hence the need for random search and automated methods. The domain is the set of values over which we search. For this problem with a GBM, the domain is as follows: We can visualize two of these distributions, the learning rate, which is logarithmic normal, and the number of leaves which is uniform normal: Although we don\\u2019t generally think of them as such, both grid and random search are algorithms. In the case of grid search, we input the domain and the algorithm selects the next value for each hyperparameter in an ordered sequence. The only requirement of grid search is that it tries every combination in a grid once (and only once). For random search, we input the domain and each time the algorithm gives us a random combination of hyperparameter values to try. There are no requirements for random search other than that the next values are selected at random. Random search can be implemented as in the following: This is in effect a very simple algorithm! The results history is a data structure that contains the hyperparameter combinations and the resulting score on the objective function. When we get to Bayesian Optimization, the model actually uses the past results to decide on the next hyperparmeters to evaluate. Random and grid search are uninformed methods that do not use the past history, but we still need the history so we can find out which hyperparameters worked the best! In this case, the results history is simply a dataframe. Automated hyperparameter tuning with bayesian optimization sounds complicated, but in fact it uses the same four parts as random search with the only difference the Algorithm used. For this competition, I used the Hyperopt library and the Tree Parzen Estimator (TPE) algorithm with the work shown in this notebook. For a conceptual explanation, refer to this article, and for an implementation in Python, check out the notebook or this article. The basic concept of Bayesian optimization is that it uses the previous evaluation results to reason about which hyperparameters perform better and uses this reasoning to choose the next values. Hence, this method should spend fewer iterations evaluating the objective function with poorer values. Theoretically, Bayesian optimization can converge on the ideal values in fewer iterations than random search (although random search can still get lucky)! The aspirations of Bayesian optimization are: This is a powerful method that promises to deliver great results. The question is, does the evidence in practice show this to be the case? To answer that, we turn to the final notebook, a deep dive into the model tuning results! After the hard work of implementing random search and Bayesian optimization, the third notebook is a fun and revealing exploration of the results. There are over 35 plots, so if you like visuals, then check it out. Although I was trying to do the whole competition on Kaggle, for these searches, I did 500 iterations of random search and 400 of Bayesian optimization which took about 5 days each on a computer with 64 GB of RAM (thanks to Amazon AWS). All the results are available, but you\\u2019ll need some serious hardware to redo the experiments! First off: which method did better? The image below summarizes the results from 501 iterations of random search and 402 of Bayesian optimization (called opt in the dataframe): Going by max score, random search does slightly better but if we measure by average score, bayesian optimization wins. The good news is this is almost exactly what we expect: random search can happen upon a great set of values because it thoroughly explores the search space, but Bayesian optimization will \\u201cfocus\\u201d on the highest scoring hyperparameter values by reasoning from previous results. Let\\u2019s take a look at a very revealing plot, the value of the cross validation score versus the number of iterations: We see absolutely no trend for random search, while Bayesian Optimization (again shown by opt ) improves over the trials. If you can understand this graph, then you can see the benefits of both methods: random search explores the search domain but Bayesian optimization gets better over time. We can also see that Bayesian optimization appears to reach a plateau, indicating diminishing returns to further trials. Second major question: what were the best hyperparameter values? Below are the optimal results from Bayesian optimization: We can use these results to build a model and submit predictions to the competition, or they can be used to inform further searches by allowing us to define a concentrated search space around the best values. One interesting aspect to consider is the values tried by each search method for each hyperparameter. The plots below show kernel density estimate (KDE) functions for each of the search methods as well as the sampling distribution (the hyperparameter grid). The dashed vertical lines indicate the optimal value found for each method. First is the learning rate: Even though the learning rate distribution stretched over several orders of magnitude, both methods found optimal values quite low in the domain. We can use this knowledge to inform further hyperparameter searches by concentrating our search in this region. In most cases, a lower learning rate increases the cross validation performance but at the cost of increased run-time, which is a trade-off we have to make. Let\\u2019s look at some other graphs. For most of the hyperparameters, the optimal values from both methods are fairly close, but not for colsample_bytree : This refers to the fraction of columns used when building each tree in the GBM, and random search found the optimal value was higher than Bayesian optimization. Again, these results can be used for further searches, as we see that the Bayesian method tended to concentrate on values around 0.65. We\\u2019ll show two more plots from this analysis because they are fairly interesting, involving two regularization parameters: What\\u2019s noteworthy here is that these two hyperparameters appear to be complements of one another: if one regularization value is high, then we want the other to be low and vice versa. Maybe this helps the model achieve a balance between bias/variance, the most common issue in machine learning. While random search does not change the distribution of values over the search, Bayesian optimization does, by concentrating on where it thinks the best values are in the search domain. We can see this by graphing the hyperparameter values against the iteration: The hyperparameters with the clearest trend are colsample_bytree and learning_rate which both continue downward over the trials. The reg_lambda and reg_alpha are diverging, which confirms our earlier hypothesis that we should decrease one of these while increasing the other. We want to be careful about placing too much value in these results, because the Bayesian optimization might have found a local minimum of the cross validation loss that it is exploiting. The trends here are pretty small, but it\\u2019s encouraging that the best value was found close to the end of the search indicating cross validation scores were continuing to improve. These next plots show the value of a single hyperparameter versus the score. We want to avoid placing too much emphasis on these graphs because we are not changing one hyperparameter at a time and there can be complex interactions between multiple hyperparameters. A truly accurate graph would be 10-dimensional and show the values of all hyperparameters and the resulting score. If we could understand a 10-dimensional graph, then we might be able to figure out the optimal combination of hyperparameters! Here the random search is in blue and the Bayesian in green: The only clear distinction is that the score decreases as the learning rate increases. We cannot say whether that is due to the learning rate itself, or some other factor (we will look at the interplay between the learning rate and the number of estimators shortly). There are not any strong trends here. The score versus subsample is a little off because boosting_type = 'goss' cannot use subsample (it must be set equal to 1.0). While we can\\u2019t look at all 10 hyperparameters at one time, we can view two at once if we turn to 3D plots! To try and examine the simultaneous effects of hyperparameters, we can make 3D plots with 2 hyperparameters and the score. A truly accurate plot would be 10-D (one for each hyperparameter) but in this case we will stick to 3 dimensions. (See the code for details, 3D plotting in Python is surprisingly straightforward). First we can show the reg_alpha and reg_lambda , the regularization hyperparameters versus the score (for Bayesian opt): It\\u2019s a little hard to make sense, but if we remember the best scores occurred around 0.5 for reg_alpha and 0.4 for reg_lambda , we can see generally better scores in this region. Next is the learning_rate and n_estimators (number of decision trees trained in the ensemble). While the learning rate was a hyperparameter in the grid, the number of decision trees (also called the number of boosting rounds) was found by early stopping with 5-fold cross validation: This time there is a clear trend: a lower learning rate and higher number of estimators increases the score. The relationship is expected because a lower learning rate means the contribution of each tree is reduced which necessitates training more trees. The expanded number of trees increases the model\\u2019s capacity to fit the training data (while also increasing the time to run). Moreover, as long as we use early stopping with enough folds, we don\\u2019t have to be concerned about overfitting with more trees. It\\u2019s nice when the results agree with our understanding (although we probably learn more when they don\\u2019t agree!) For the final plot, I wanted to show the correlations between each hyperparameter and each other and the score. These plots can\\u2019t prove causation, but they can tell us which variables are correlated: We already found most of the information from the graphs, but we can see the negative correlation between the learning rate and the score, and the positive correlation between the number of estimators and the score. The final step of the exploration was to implement both the random search best hyperparameters and the Bayesian optimization best hyperparameters on a full dataset (the dataset comes from this kernel and I would like to thank the author for making it public). We train the model, make predictions on the testing set, and finally upload to the competition to see how we do on the public leaderboard. After all the hard work, do the results hold up? If we go by best score on the public leaderboard, Bayesian Optimization wins! However, the public leaderboard is based only on 10% of the test data, so it\\u2019s possible this is a result of overfitting to this particular subset of the testing data. Overall, I would say the complete results \\u2014 including cross validation and public leaderboard \\u2014 suggest that both methods produce similar outcomes when run for enough iterations. All we can say for sure is that either method is better than hand-tuning! Our final model is enough to move us 1000 places up the leaderboard compared to our previous work. Finally, to end with one more plot, we can take a look at the feature importances from the trained GBM: NEW_CREDIT_TO_ANNUITY_RATIO and NEW_EXT_SOURCES_MEAN were features derived by the data science community on Kaggle and not in the original data. It\\u2019s reassuring to see these so high up in the importance because it shows the value of feature engineering. The major takeaways from this work are: Where to go from here? Well, there are always plenty of other methods to try such as automated feature engineering or treating the problem as a time-series. I\\u2019ve already done a notebook on automated feature engineering so that will probably be where my focus will turn next. We can also try other models or even journey into the realm of deep learning! I\\u2019m open to suggestions, so let me know on Kaggle or on Twitter. Thanks for reading, and if you want to check out any of my other work on this problem, here are the complete set of notebooks: There should be enough content there to keep anyone busy for a little bit. Now it\\u2019s off to do more learning/exploration for the next post! The best part about data science is that you\\u2019re constantly on the move, looking for the next technique to conquer. Whenever I find out what that is, I\\u2019ll be sure to share it! As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.

All code for this project can be found on my GitHub repository for the class. I highly recommend the course to anyone interested in data analysis (that is anyone who wants to make sense of the mass amounts of data generated in our modern world) as well as to those who want to learn basic programming skills in an applied setting. This version of the Exploratory Data Analysis project has all the code removed for readability. The version with all the R code included is also on Medium. Doctor\\u2019s appointment no-shows are a serious issue in the public health care field. Missed appointments are associated with poorer patient outcomes and cost the health care system in the US nearly $200 each. Therefore, it comes as no small surprise that reducing the rate of no-shows has become a priority in the United States and around the world. Numerous studies have been undertaken in order to determine the most effective means of\\nreducing rates of absenteeism at with varying degrees of success. The first step to solving the problem of missed appointments is identifying why a patient skips a scheduled visit in the first place. What trends are there among patients with higher absence rates? Are there demographic indicators or perhaps time-variant relationships hiding in the data? Ultimately, it was these questions that drove my exploratory data analysis. I was curious as to the reasons behind missed appointments, and wanted to examine the data to identify any trends present. I choose this problem because I believe it is an excellent example of how data science and analysis can reveal relationships which can be implemented in the real-world to the benefit of society. I wanted to choose a dataset that was both relatable and could be used to make smarter decisions. Therefore, I decided to work with medical appointment no shows data available on Kaggle. This dataset is drawn from 300,000 primary physician visits in Brazil across 2014 and 2015. The information about the appointment was automatically coded when the patient scheduled the appointment and then the patient was marked as having either attended or not. The information about the appointment included demographic data, time data, and conditions concerning the reason for the visit. There were a total of 14 variables I included from the original data. The variables and the description of the values are as follows Let\\u2019s take a look at the structure of the dataframe to identify cleaning/organizing that may need to be performed. From the structure of the dataframe, I can see there is some data housekeeping that needs to be done. First, I want to change the Status variable into an integer 0 or 1. A value of 1 will indicate that the patient did not show up as I am concerned with the variables that are most strongly correlated with a missed appointment. Moreover, I need to convert the registration date and the appointment date to date objects. I decided not to maintain the time (hours:minutes:seconds) associated with the registration date for the appointment although it was available (time of day was not available for the appointment date). I converted both the appointment registration date and appointment date to date objects so I could investigate seasonal and time patterns in the data. Based on the updated structure of the dataframe, it looks like I am on the right track but I still have a couple more modifications to make to the dataframe. I will create month, year, and day fields for the appointment and also rename the columns to a more consistent and readable format. That should about do it for the structure of the main dataframe. I am also concerned with missing/corrupted data, so I will look at the summary of each field to see if any obvious errors or outliers are present in the data. The summary of the no_shows dataframe reveals plenty of intriguing information as well as several errors that need to be corrected. Right away, it is clear that an age of -2 is not correct, and 113 is stretching the boundaries. However, looking at the oldest people in the world, it is plausible that 113 could be a correct age. I will filter out any negative ages and create a histogram of ages to see if there are a significant amount of outliers at the upper end. Moreover, this data summary shows that 30.24% of appointments are missed based on the mean for the status field. The rates for the various patient conditions can also be seen, and the most commonly coded reason for an appointment is hypertension at nearly 22% of visits. Also, the weekends appear to be a very unpopular time for doctor\\u2019s appointments in Brazil, or perhaps the clinics from which this data was drawn are not open on the weekend. Either way, I will need to keep the small sample size of appointments on the weekend in mind when I perform an analysis by weekday. Frequency Distribution of Ages The age histogram does not aligh exactly with my intutions though it is close. I expected that it would be bi-modal, with peaks in patient count at the youngest ages and at the oldest ages. However, while the largest number of patients do appear to be the youngest, the number of patients remains fairly constant into the middle ages, with a second peak around age 60 and then a steep decline into the oldest ages. Based on the visualization, there do not appear to be a large number of outliers in the upper range of the ages. I was skeptical of the high proportion of visits from those aged 0 and decided I needed to do some research. Based on the description of the dataset, this data is for primary care physicians in the public sector and so I looked for a breakdown of ages of patients at these appointments. I could not find statistics from Brazil, but based on official statistics from the Centers for Disease Control in the United States, children under 1 year of age make up 2.6% of all physician visits. I can create a better plot showing the percentage each age is of all patients. I can also quickly check the percentage of visits comprised of patients aged 0 in the data. Percentage of patients with an age of 0:\\n3.442069% The calculation shows that 0-year olds make up 3.44% of visits. While the initial frequency distribution may looked skewed, the spread of the data along the years makes it look like 0-year olds make up considerably more of the visits than is actually the case. The corrected bar plot does a better job of representing the proportion of patients from each age. From the research by the CDC and the visualization, I conclude that the age distribution skew is not bad but rather legitimate data. To check for outliers in the waiting time field (or how long between the date the appointment was made and the actual date of the appointment), I will make another histogram. Based on the summary statistics of the dataframe, the longest waiting time was 398 days, with a median of 8 days, and a mean of 13.84 days. From the histogram and the statistics, it is clear that there are a small number of patients at the upper end of the distribution who schedule their appointment very far in advance. I wonder if the 398 days is accidentally a mistake that occured when someone choose the wrong year for their appointment! The graph is certainly long-tailed and positively skewed with a few extreme outliers at the upper limit. Number of patients with wait time longer than one year:\\n1\\nNumber of patients with wait time longer than six months:\\n136 It appears there is only one patient with a waiting time over one year and just over 100 (out of 300000) with a waiting time of over six months. I will exclude the patient with the waiting time over one year, but I will treat the others as good but extreme data. Here is a version of the histogram that better represents the wait time for most patients. As can be seen in the chart, a plurality of patients wait less than 10 days between the scheduling and the date of their appointment. Based on these visualizations, and the summary statistics for the dataframe, I am confident that the data content of the main dataframe is valid. I can now start the exploration phase of exploratory data analysis! It is time to discover the relationships, or lack thereof, between the variables in the data. The first step I can take is to find the correlations between all of the columns to see if any stand out as particularly compelling. Of course, I expect that all the trends will not reveal themselves straight away. The rcorr function from the Hmisc library will calculate the Pearson\\u2019s correlation coeffient between every field of a dataframe. The Pearson correlation coefficient, is a measure of how linearly dependent two variables on each other. The coefficient value is between -1 and +1, and two variables that are perfectly linearly correlated will have a value of +1. From those correlation values, there are no standouts that are strong linear predictors of whether or not a patient will miss a visit (given by the status column). It appears that there are not even any strong relationships whatsoever though there is a moderate relationship between age and hypertension. However, I still think there are meaningful relationships to extract from the data. My approach will be to group the data by various fields and then determine if the average absence rate shows a relationship with the fields. The first group of variables I will look at will be those associated with the time-variability of the appointment date. Date of Appointment To start off the time-series analysis, I will want to look at absence rate by month of the year. I first needed to group the appointments by month of year and then find the average absence rate for each month. From the graph and the correlation coefficient, it appears there is a minor relationship between month of the year and absence rate. Missed visits do appear to rise as the year progresses, but with only 12 data points, the 95% confidence interval for the correlation coefficient is quite large (-0.05 to 0.85). I would expect that during the end of the year, people tend to be busier and may miss more appointments. It could also be possible that at the beginning of the year, individuals make resolutions to see the doctor and keep a higher percentage of appointments, but the trend could also be noise. Next, I will create a similar absence rate over time graph, but this time by day of the month. Looking at the plot we can see that there is a very slight positive correlation between day of the month and absence rate but again, the 95% confidence interval spans a wide range of values. To further explore any time variability in the data, I can create the same graph by day of the year and broken out by gender. Mean absence rate for males:\\n30.99653%\\nMean absence rate for females\\n29.86962% From these charts, it appears looks as if there is no correlation betwen the time of year and the absence rate for appointments. Moreover, adding in the gender does not reveal any major descrepancies, although from the calculation, we can see that men on average have a 1% higher absence rate. There are several days for which the absence rate is 1, which bears some more investigation. My idea is that these points might corespond to public holidays. However, I also see that these days are not consistent across the two years, so maybe there are other major events that correspond to an increase in absences. I decided to overlay the holidays to see if that might reveal a relationship. I sourced the holidays based on public holidays in Brazil for each respective year. Again, it seems as if these holidays do not line up with higher rates of missed appointments. There is a sustained increase in the absence rate around the beginning of July, but it does not seem to correspond to any holidays. I researched festivals in Brazil in June-July 2015, and it appears that the Paraty International Literary Festival occured July 1\\u20135, but I doubt that this explains the absence rate. There was not city data associated with the original dataset, so it is difficult to attempt to cross-reference specific dates with specific events.\\nI will create a simliar graph for 2014. I remember that the 2014 soccer World Cup was held in Brazil, so perhaps the time around the world cup will have a higher absence rate. I will plot a few holidays and then the dates surrounding the World Cup (which lasted for a month). Perhaps there is a slight increase in absence rate during the World Cup? The graph does not clearly indicate either was but I can compare the average absence rate during the World Cup to the average absence rate over the entire length of 2014.Mean absence rate during all of 2014\\\\ [1] 30.08656\\nMean absence rate during 2014 World Cup\\n[1] 30.79473 There is a small but not significant increase in the absence rate during the World Cup. It looks like in terms of time variability, there is no significant correlation based on the day of the year or the day of the month. There is one more time variation I want to look at, and that is day of the week. To remind myself of the small sample sizes on the weekend, I also show the appointment days of the week count. Finally, it looks like there might be some time variability in this data when it is broken down by weekday. Excluding Saturday and Sunday because of their small sample sizes, Monday and Friday have the highest absence rate and Tuesday has the lowest. I will alter the plot to show the absence rate as a relative percentage change from the overall mean absence rate. Based on this chart, patients are 6% more likely to miss an appointment on a Monday compared to the overall average absence rate, and 4% less likely to miss an appointment on a Tuesday. This is an actionable discovery for both patients and doctors! If patients want to keep their appointments, and if doctors want to make sure their patients show up, they should schedule their appointments during the middle three days of the week. Patient Age I wanted to move on from the time variability and look at the demographic data. In particular, I am interested in whether or not age is correlated with absence rate. My initial guess would be that the youngest and the oldest patients would tend to have lower absence rates. Meanwhile, those patients in the middle would generally be healthier and thus would feel more inclined to skip an appointment. (Everyone is convinced they are invincible in their 20s. In fact, this was one of the issues associated with the initial rollout of Obamacare. Too many young, healthy individuals did not believe they needed insurance and therefore did not sign up for healthcare.) First I will group patients by age and then visualize the average absence rates. The chart reveals the possibility of a negative relationship between age and absence rate. First though, it is clear that the outliers in the upper end of the data introduce substantial variance. As there are only 719 patients over 90 out of 300000 entries, I think I can filter out any ages over 90 without impacting the validating of the data while reducing the noise. I will use that filter and then improve the aesthetics of the graph. We can observe that the youngest ages have a relatively low absence rate with an exception for 1-year-olds. The absence rate then climbs for teenagers, peaking around age 20, before beginning a long, gradual decline to around 70, at which point the absence rate rises again slightly. I would like to know precisely which ages have the highest and lowest absence rates. Moreover, what is the pearson correlation between age and absence rate? Maximum absence rate of 40.21% occurs at age 18\\nMinimum absence rate of 20.25% occurs at age 72 Here are more actionable conclusions. Public health officials need to work on getting teenagers to show up to their appointments! This is expecially crucial because studies have shown that habits form very early and are hard to change later in life. A trend of going to the doctor while younger will likely persist as a patient ages and lead to better lifelong health. We can further bin the data in five years increments to highlight the \\u201cproblem years\\u201d, that is, the years with the highest missed appointment rate. I will plot the relative absence rate, or the average age group absence rate as a percentage relative to the average absence rate for all ages. Remember, in this plot, below the x-axis is better because it indicates that the age group has a lower rate of missed appointments than the average. Based on the chart, is it clear that the worst group in terms of absence rate is 15\\u201320 year-olds and the best group for attedance is 70\\u201375 year-olds. The visualization and the statistics are definitive when it comes to ages and missed appointments. The correlation between ages and absence rate is -0.86, which is strongly negative and indicates that as the age of the patient increases, statistically, that patient is less likely to miss a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. Waiting Time After finding a strong relationship between age and absence rate, I will move on to examine other variables. I would like to search for a possible trend in absence rate by waiting time, or the time between when an appointment was scheduled, and when the appointment took place. My hypothesis is that patients with a longer waiting time will have a higher missed appointment rate because their condition has more time to change in the interim period. Moreover, I think that patients with a shorter waiting time are more likely to need urgent care or have a problem they deem to be pressing, and it would certainly be in their best interest to show up at the appointment. The graph and the correlation coefficient seem to demonstrate a lack of any relationship. However, thinking back on the histogram of waiting time from the initial exploration, the majority of the patients waited under 100 days. There are far fewer data points from people waiting more than 100 days, which is why the average absence rate for those times tends to be either 0% or 100%. If I limit the data to people with a waiting time less than 3 months (90 days), might there exist a relationship? Furthermore, I will group the data into 10 day segments. Patients with a waiting time over 90 days\\n1646 If the data is limited to those patients who scheduled fewer than 3 months in advance, there is a slight positive correlation between waiting time and absence rate. I tried to do some research on this subject in general, and found this from the Safety Net Dental Clinic: \\u201cExperience in many safety net dental programs also suggests that the incidence of broken appointments increases when appointments are scheduled more than three weeks in advance.\\u201d Based on my analysis, I concur. Patients who schedule less than 10 days out are 20% less likely to miss an appointment than those scheduling further out. The Safety Net Dental Clinic page mentions that often other life events get in the way when we schedule too far out, and although that may be a slightly different situation, the general pattern appears to hold in this case. Add a point to schedule as few days out as possible to the list of recommendations for patients looking to adhere to a scheduled appointment. SMS Reminders One of the most intriguing aspects of the dataset to me was the SMS (Short Message Service) text message reminder counts. Text message reminders have been implemented in many clinics because of their ease of use and low cost. Moreover, they have been shown to be effective in some situations. I want to examine this data to discover how or if SMS messages correlate with a failure to attend. I would think that patients who recieve SMS messages will be more likely to attend the appointment than those not receiving them. However, this could be complicated by the fact that younger patients are more likely to sign up for text message alerts, and as we have already seen, young individuals are more inclined to be record a no-show. Therefore, I will probably need to further look at who exactly is recieving the text messages in addition to the correlation between text messages and attendance at the appointment. The graph is somewhat surprising to me; one text message seems to decrease the absence rate while two increases the absence rate significantly. I would have expected more SMS reminders to be strongly correlated with a decrease in absence rate. Maybe the direction of this relationship is the opposite of what I thought. Instead of SMS messages persuading patients to attend a scheduled appointment, patients who are least likely to attend an appointment receive more text messages. One way to check for this would be to look at average SMS messages per appointment received by age. I expect there might be odd behavior at the ends of this graph (how young do children receive their first phone nowadays? Has the average 80-year old embraced text messages?). I expect that segmenting by age might reveal more nuances than the overall absence rate vs text messages. Sure enough, the average number of SMS reminders per appointment is greater among the younger ages. I looked through the data provider information, and I could not ascertain whether or not those SMS reminders were to the parent in the case of a very young child but that seems likely. From the statistics and the plot, there is a strong negative correlation between the number of SMS messages and the age of the patient. To further explore the absence rate vs text message, I will recreate the absence rate vs age graph, but this time, create separate curves for number of SMS reminders received. Looking at the graph, we can see that the absence rate versus age grouped by number of SMS reminders looks much the same for the 0 or 1 reminders. However, the graph for 2 reminders is much noisier. I suspect that is due to the lower sample size of people receiving two reminders (which was the maximum). In order to determine if there is an effect from text message reminders at a given age, I need to create a plot showing the difference in absence rates at each age between those receiving any reminder and those receiving no reminder. Indeed, it does appears that at a given age, the absence rate decreases with 1 or 2 text messages reminders. In fact, the average difference in absence rate holding age constant is -0.57%. That means that having receiving an SMS reminder at a given age decreases the chance that a patient will miss a scheduled appointment by 0.6%. This may seem small, but it could add up over millions of appointments. Moreover, there are certain ages when the effect of the SMS reminders is much greater. The reduction in missed appointments is as great as 2% at age ten and near 3% during other years. This reduction in the failure to attend rate is also what research into text message reminders has found. One study,conducted in Brazil, found: \\u201cThe nonattendance reduction rates for appointments at the four outpatient clinics studied were 0.82% (p = .590), 3.55% (p = .009), 5.75% (p = .022), and 14.49% (p = <.001).\\u201d Furthermore, the conclusion of this research was: \\u201cThe study results indicate that sending appointment reminders as text messages to patients\\u2019 cell phones is an effective strategy to reduce nonattendance rates. When patients attend their appointments, the facility providing care and the patients receiving uninterrupted care benefit.\\u201d Based on my analysis of the data, I must concur that at a given age, SMS reminders decrease the absence rate. Another valuable piece of information that could be quite easily implemented in the real world to improve outcomes! Patient Markers The final step in this exploratory analysis is to look at the absence rate by the condition for which the patient visited the doctor. I will group by the markers in the original data and then look at each average absence rate. There are considerable differences illustrated between those with different markers. Tuberculosis has the highest rate of absence, followed by alcoholism. However, these conditions also make up a small sample of the overall visits. Diabetes and hypertension have the lowest absence rate. Interestingly, patients marked as being part of the Bolsa Familia welfare program have a high rate of absences. This program rewards patients for attending appointments, which should induce patients to visit their doctor more often. Perhaps there are other factors at play here though. It could be that families on the welfare program cannot take the time to visit the doctor because of the opportunity cost of not working. To put the conditions in perspective, here is the percentage of all visits each condition makes up. The final plot I can make is of the conditions and the relative percentage difference in absence rates compared to the mean absence rate. Relative difference plots are helpful to me because it is possible to quickly identify if one variable is above or below the average. Again, for this particular plot, values below the x-axis are great because it means the absence rate is lower than the overall average. The differences between conditions here are stark. Again, the smaller sample sizes associated with alcoholism and tuberculosis must be taken into account, but it is clear that patients with diabetes and hypertension are more likely to attend an appointment. In fact, they are more than 15% less likely to miss an appointment then the average patient. This is an interesting result and I wonder if it is because of the constant need for care when treating both of these conditions. However, it would seem like all of the conditions require care on an ongoing basis. I would need more detailed condition information before I drew any conclusions about possible causes of the absence rates broken out by condition. I started this project off with a single simple question: what factors are most likely to determine whether or not a patient shows up to their scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment? As the exploratory data analysis went on, I found this one question had branched into dozens. Does the number of SMS reminders correlate with absence rates? How about if we compare SMS reminders for a given age? Are there major variabilities that we can observe associated with holidays? I found my curiousity and interest in the dataset only grew as I delved further and further. Although at first it appeared there were few meaningful relationships, by grouping and segmenting the data, clear trends emerged. Keeping in mind that this dataset may not be representative of all countries and health care systems, the following are the most notable discoveries from the patient no-show data: 2. There is a slight positive correlation between absence rate and the day of the month and as the month progresses, the percentage of missed appointments rises moderately. 3. There is no correlation in the absence rate over the days of the year. 4. Excluding the weekends, the day of the week with the highest absence rate is Monday followed by Friday. Tuesday had the lowest rate of absences with appointments on Tuesday 4% more likely to be attended than those on the other days of the week. 5. The age of patients was demonstrated a strong negative linear correlation with absence rates with a correlation coefficient of -0.86. 6. There was a slight positive correlation between the rate of missed appointments and how many days in advance the patient scheduled the appointment. 7. When looking at the dataset as a whole, patients who recieved two SMS reminders were more likely to miss an appointment than those who recieved no reminders. However, the correlation between age and average text messages recieved was -0.80 meaning that younger patients, who were more likely to miss appointments overall, received more text messages. Subsequently, the effect of text messages reminders can only be revealed by looking at messages received at a given age. 8. Patients whose appointments were marked for tuberculosis and alcoholism were the most likely to miss the visit, while those coded for hypertension and diabetes were the least likely to miss their appointment. These are but a few briefs observations that can be gleaned from this dataset. Keeping in mind that correlations do not imply causations (more serious link for those interested), and that some of the groupings results in small sample sizes, there are actionable items that with appropriate further study, could be implemented in the health care system. The final aspect of the project was to revisit and refine three of my earlier plots. Primarily I am concerned with whether or not the visualizations correctly convey the information within the dataset. My secondary objective is of course aesthetics because what good is even the most informative chart if it is not presentable? Absence Rate vs. Day of the Year This first chart was notable to me because of the lack of relationships it revealed. It is the graph of absence rate versus day of the year in 2014 with holidays (and the World Cup) included. I would have initially believed that absence rates spiked around holidays and near the end of the year. However, no clear trend emerged from this plot. In order to improve the information content and the aesthetics, I altered some of the colors, changed the scale on the axis, added in the mean absence rate for reference, and made sure all labels were accurate. The conclusion to draw from this visualization is that there is no trend in rate of missed appointments over the year by day. Even on major public holidays (of which the World Cup may be the greatest!) there is no noticeable change in absence rate around or on the holiday. This was backed up by the correlation coefficient which showed no linear relationship between day of year and the failure to attend statistic. The overall mean, plotted as the horizontal black line, shows the absence rate for all patients was 30.24%. Women on average had a slightly lower rate of 29.87% and men had a slightly higher rate at 31.00%. The gender discrepancy can barely be picked out on the graph, but it is present. Absence Rate vs. Age by SMS Reminders The second crucial visualization is the absence rate versus age broken down by number of SMS reminders. When I initially looked at the data showing that overall, people who received 2 text message reminders had higher absences rates, I was a little skeptical. However, after some thought, I realized that people who received text messages were likely to be younger, and I had seen that the younger the patient, the higher the absence rate. Therefore, I decided to look at the effect of text messages reminders at each given age. Based on the resulting chart, I saw that indeed, SMS reminders do reduce the absence rate at a specific age. To make the point clearer in the plot below, I plotted the average absence rate vs age for those who received no text reminders and for those who received either 1 or 2 reminders. The original graph was very noisy, so I applied a moving average over 5 years. The 5 year window was a selection based on the bias-variance tradeoff because while I wanted a smoother plot, I did not want to introduce a high amount of bias into the averages. After improving the graph, it is possible to observe the trend of fewer absences at older ages and the effectiveness of SMS reminders in reducing the failure to attend rate. The main two takeaways from this visualization are that as age increases, the absence rate decreases, and, at a given age, patients who receive at least one SMS reminder miss fewer appointments. The age distribution of missed appointments was in line with what I had expected, although I would have initially guessed that children under 10 would have the low absence rates comparable to what was observed in those aged 40 and over. It was not surprising to me that patients in their teens and early 20s had the highest failure to attend rate and it is clear that more effort needs to be expended in ensuring that this age group shows up for their appointments. This is one application where text message reminders could be most useful. Looking at the chart, it is also possible to observe that the rate of no-shows for those receiving an SMS reminder is lower than that for those recieving no reminder at almost every age. Overall, for a given age, text message reminders resulted in absence rates 0.5% lower which could make a substantial impact on the scale on a national health care system. Absence Rate vs. Waiting Time The third vital graph from this analysis was the relative absence rate vs waiting time graph. This graph displays the absence rate relative the overall mean absence rate for patient groups based on how far in advance they scheduled their appointment. I initially grouped the waiting time, or the elasped days between when the appointment was made and when the appointment occurred, by groups of five days. I then plotted the relative absence rate compared to the overall average for each group. I was surprised to discover how much lower the absence rate was for those sceduling less than 10 days in advance. To improve the plot, I increased the resolution of the graph by narrowing the bin widths to groups of 3 days. I also decided to add in a model created with the LOESS, Local Regression, method of regression. I created a simple model and then used the prediction it generated for each age grouping to draw a curve. The graph reveals the crucial information that appointments scheduled shorter out tend to have higher attendance rates. The actionable takeaway for patients from this graph is to schedule appointments on a shorter time scale, preferentially less than 10 days in advance. The absence rate for those whose appointments were scheduled only 3 days or less in advance was nearly 30% lower relative to the overall absence rate. Moreover, the model shows that the trend in increasing absence rate with longer waiting times is nearly linear for the first month. After that point, the noise in the visualization increases, but the majority of groups with wait times over 12 days had a higher absence rate than the mean. Patients would be wise to schedule their appointments as soon as possible in order to follow through on visiting the doctor. Taken together, these three visualizations illustrate several pieces of advice for patients and doctors who have a mutal interest in driving the absence rate as low as possible:\\n1. Day of the year does not affect the absence rate even near the holidays.\\n2. Young adults are the most likely to miss their appointments and therefore will need extra prodding to attend an appointment. This prodding can come in the form of SMS reminders, which reduce the absence rate for a given age.\\n3. Patients should schedule appointments as few days in advance as possible. Ideally appointments would occur within 9 days of being scheduled to increase the chance of attendance. The primary reason I wanted to learn the tools of data analysis was in order to could extract meaningful information from the mounds of data generated in our modern world. I want to be able to take hundreds of thousands or even millions of data points and extract insights which can be implemented in the real world to improve human institutions, such as the medical system. Exploring the patient no-show dataset has been a small step towards developing that ability. Although the sheer amount of data appeared overwhelming at first, and there were no correlations that immediately stood out, by selectively grouping the data and adjusting the visualization parameters, I was able to discover several key relationships.\\nThe main difficulty I had was beginning the analysis. With so many variables, it was a struggle to decide where I should first concentrate. However, once I started grouping the data, I found more and more directions I could explore until I felt that I was satisfied with the extent to which I had unraveled the data. The trends and patterns in the datadictate the questions that we should ask of it. R is a tricky language to pick up, but once I understood the patterns and syntax, I enjoyed the level of control it gave me over the visualizations. I was frustrated at times trying to perfect parameters of a graph, but in the end, I think I am a better data analyst because I had to work through all the intricacies of the R language. The next step forward, now that the exploratory data analysis of the no-shows dataset is complete, is to perform confirmatory data analysis. Based on my initial observations, I could form several hypotheses and then use rigorous statistical methods to test those hypothesis. Exploratory data analysis can discover potential relationships, but it takes statistical testing to determine whether these correlations are statistically meaningful. Moreover, this dataset is an ideal candidate for using machine learning to create classifiers that would identify patients likely to be a no-show at an appointment. The objective would be to make a model that would take in as features patient demographics and conditions, and would return the likelihood that a patient would fail to attend a scheduled doctor\\u2019s appointment. If the model was accurate enough, it could then be implemented in the real-world by ensuring that patients most likely to miss a doctor\\u2019s visit receive additional persuasion. Moreover, with a more complete dataset, including city information or detailed demographics, more relationships could be discovered such as absence rate correlations with the weather or with access to public transportation. The initial exploratory data analysis of the doctor\\u2019s appointment no-show data has revealed numerous potential relationships. The dataset holds actionable information and this project demonstrates the benefits of not just collecting large amounts of data, but thoroughly analyzing it to find the correlations that could be used to improve patient outcomes and public health. Originally published at medium.com on August 8, 2017.\",\n          \"In his sweeping 2011 work The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence has Declined, Steven Pinker makes the audacious claim, \\u201ctoday we may be living in the most peaceable era in our species\\u2019 existence.\\u201d To someone who pays even a little attention to constant news reports of violence, both local and international, this statement sounds ludicrous. The grandeur of this assertion should immediately raise our suspicions; as the science popularizer Carl Sagan often said, \\u201cextraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.\\u201d Does Pinker have that evidence and does he interpret it correctly? Over the course of 800 pages, Pinker makes a convincing argument with numbers, figures, and references to many books and articles. Nonetheless, it\\u2019s critical that we don\\u2019t rely on a single argument to form our worldview. We must remember that data is never objective, and therefore we need to look at the data itself as well as multiple expert interpretations. In this article, we\\u2019ll examine the global violent conflict data and different stances on the same numbers. (As a note, Pinker\\u2019s work deals with all forms of violence from the individual \\u2014 homicides, abuse \\u2014 to the worldwide, but here we\\u2019ll focus on international violent conflicts \\u2014 war \\u2014 and leave the rest for future articles). This is Episode 2 of the Reality Project, an endeavor with the aim of becoming less wrong about the world with data. You can find all the articles here. (I\\u2019d like to emphasize I\\u2019m not trying to minimize the atrocities of war by presenting only data. It can be easy to lose track that we are talking about people when looking at numbers and every loss of human life is a tragedy.) Our primary sources of derived data on the more positive side will be The Better Angels of Our Nature by Steven Pinker and the \\u201cWar and Peace\\u201d page on Our World in Data. For a contrasting viewpoint, we\\u2019ll use \\u201cSteven Pinker is Wrong\\u201d by John Gray and \\u201cThe Decline of Conflict: What Do the Data Really Say?\\u201d by Pasquale Cirillo and Nassim Nicholas Taleb. You can find raw data for your own analysis at The Conflict Catalog or the World Bank. The first question we need to ask to assess violence today is how violent was the past. While extremely reliable data is difficult to come by, anthropologists use archaeological evidence to determine causes of death and therefore approximate the rates of violence in a society. These results are shown in the following graphs of percentages of deaths that come from violent conflict in prehistoric and non-state societies (from Our World in Data). The percentages of individuals killed by violence ranges from about 60% to less than 5% in both prehistoric and nonstate societies. Those numbers are almost meaningless until we put them in perspective with modern figures: The most relevant entries are the final two. The US and Europe from 1900\\u20131960, even with two world wars, saw less than 1% of their population perish in armed conflicts. In 2007, just 0.04% of deaths in the world were from international violence. If this data is correct, the world in 2007 was at least an order of magnitude safer than most prehistoric societies. We can also look at the same data in a slightly different manner, as the violent deaths per 100,000 citizens per year. Here we again see the same pattern of lower violence in modern times. On the left are non-state societies and on the right are state societies. Focusing on the bottom 3 rows of the right-hand table, we can see the strikingly low rates of violent death among modern societies, even accounting for two world wars. Again, it\\u2019s worth stressing the data here is not complete, but what is available suggests the following hypothesis: prehistoric and nonstate societies experienced much higher rates of violence than modern state societies. As Pinker and others (notably Jared Diamond) have made clear, the \\u201cnoble savage\\u201d idea is entirely false. People did not live peacefully with one another when they were organized in tribes and then become more violent as they were civilized, but the opposite: they were extremely violent in tribes and gradually became less so as larger civilizations were built and commerce started to connect the world (this highlights two of the drivers in the decline of global war \\u2014 trade and powerful states \\u2014 that we\\u2019ll look at shortly). Even accounting for the atrocities wrought by nation-states in the 20th century, rates of violent death appear to be lower now than at any previous point. It\\u2019s worth looking into the period of time for which we have the best data: the modern age. In particular, we\\u2019ll zoom in on the post-1945 era, a time that Pinker has classified as \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d. From this vantage point, things look very good. As noted by Pinker, since 1953, there have been zero conflicts between major world powers (the exception since WW2 was the Korean War) and there have been zero internationally recognized states that have gone out of existence through conquest since 1945. When we look at the data on battle deaths per 100,000 people in state-based conflicts, we see a significant decline since World War Two. Since the end of the second world war, the rate of deaths from all conflicts has decreased, with the most noticeable decline in conflicts between states. Most of the remaining battle deaths occur in civil conflicts, such as the tragic civil war in Syria that has been ongoing since 2011. Moreover, many of these civil wars involve foreign states, and the argument could be made major states have stopped fighting each other directly, but engage through other conflicts. One discouraging bit of news in contrast to the above graph is the number of overall state conflicts since the second world war: While the number of battle-related deaths (in the rate of people killed / 100,000 / year) has decreased, the total number of conflict is rising. This tells us that, contrary to what we might think as weapon technology advances, violent conflicts are resulting in fewer battle deaths. While, there are more civil conflicts around the globe, these tend to be less catastrophic than wars between major powers. Fortunately, the wars between major states have been on the decline \\u2014 even including the entire 20th century \\u2014 and show no signs of reversal. We can see this in the final chart of section showing the percent of the time major powers have been at war over the past 500 years (grouped into 25-year periods). There has been a clear decline in the percentage of years in which the major powers fought with one another since at least 1600. At one point the rate reached 100% \\u2014 indicating there was at least one conflict between world powers for the entire 25-year period. Contrast that with 2000, when there were 0 conflicts between world powers. The current period of 66 years without a conflict between major powers is the longest time since at least the Roman Empire. After an exploration of the data thus far, Pinker\\u2019s argument looks to be holding up: the rate of death in battle for modern state societies in war is much lower than prehistoric and non-state societies even accounting for the world wars. Furthermore, the major powers no longer fight one another and while the number of civil conflicts has increased, these result in fewer deaths than conflicts between major states. However, before we consider this case to be closed we need to talk about one fundamental issue. Consider the following two scenarios: Which is worse? The question depends on your observation point. On the ground, observing from the location of the conflict itself, the bar is much worse. An individual in the bar has a 1 in 2 chance of being killed. From an outsider\\u2019s vantage point the civil war is much worse with a total loss of life 10 times greater. This is one of the central arguments that Pinker\\u2019s critics make: measuring violence in rates ignores the absolute numbers which means it does not account for the actual amount of human suffering. One of Pinker\\u2019s harshest critics, Nassim Taleb, brings up the point of units in his response. He illustrates it with the following pair of plots: The graph on the left shows the raw number of casualties versus time for major conflicts. The graph on the right shows the rescaled version where the populations have been standardized across all times to have the same base population. As an example, if we have a population 100 society that suffers 2 deaths and a society with 1000 people that suffers 10, we would multiply 2 * 10 to get 20 deaths to account for the population difference. These figures encapsulate the rates/absolute numbers argument: the rates of death in violent conflicts have clearly been decreasing and are at a historical low, but the actual number of deaths has increased over time. Although, it\\u2019s worth pointing out the actual number has decreased since 1950. I don\\u2019t know if I have an answer for you on this problem of relative/absolute. As a utilitarian, I believe in bringing the greatest amount of total good to the greatest amount of people, and therefore, I see the total number of humans dead as the mark of how our civilization has failed. On the other side of the argument, a human alive today has less probability of being killed in a violent conflict than at any point in the past which is no doubt progress. I\\u2019ll let the facts stand and allow you to decide for yourself. Even if we don\\u2019t want to make a judgment on the overall outcome, it\\u2019s worth taking a look at the potential causes for the reduction in rates of violence. In particular, we might want to think about why the total number of deaths (in addition to the relative measures) have fallen since 1945. For this section, we will look at Steven Pinker\\u2019s ideas as outlined in The Better Angels of Our Nature. (This work is the best look at potential reasons why violence has declined \\u2014 partly because others refuse to concede this point). Pinker explains five forces, intended to account for the decline of violence on all scales, not just state-based conflicts, but we\\u2019ll focus on the first two which are most relevant to international conflict. The five historical forces behind the reduction in violence are: A powerful central government that can make and enforce laws using violence means that citizens are less likely to take punishment into their own hands, a concept known as the Leviathon theory. For all its romantic appeal, vigilante justice only leads to unending cycles of revenge violence. When citizens can count on a government to deliver fair punishments, they let the judicial system enforce the rules. Also, a state can prevent crime by making the penalty far greater than any potential payoff. Humans have the potential for both evil and good, and a strong central government with a fair criminal justice system with disincentives can steer them on the right path. A strong government alone is not enough for keeping the peace between nations though. On an international scale, the evidence suggests that democracies don\\u2019t fight each other possibly because of the ideals they share in common. Looking at some of the data, it\\u2019s clear that democracies just don\\u2019t fight one another directly anymore (although they may engage in proxy war). (For more on this concept see \\u201cDemocratic Peace Theory.\\u201d) The idea that one democratic nation will not fight another is good news as democracies on the rise in the long run worldwide as shown by Pinker: (One counterpoint is the recent decline in Democratic Index which measures not just the government but also freedom of the press and voting rights. Although the long-term trends are positive, the recent declines are worrying.) The theory of gentle commerce can be summed up in two statements: Why don\\u2019t you steal a loaf of bread from the grocery store? Although most people believe they don\\u2019t steal because it\\u2019s the wrong thing to do, the real reason is more mundane: in our society, the potential cost of getting caught stealing \\u2014 jail time and social ostracization \\u2014 are higher than the cost to purchase items. When people are provided a legal means to obtain their goods that is cheaper than violence, they will take the legal option. We explored the second point in \\u201cThe Disappearing Poor\\u201d, but it\\u2019s worth reiterating. Without exchanges in a market economy, all interactions between humans are zero-sum: you can steal something from me, but your gain is offset by my loss so humanity is no better off; the size of the economy stays the same. However, in an exchange of goods, both parties come out better ahead. Exchange also allows for specialization so different individuals/countries can make the goods for which they are best suited. Moreover, as trade continues, countries become dependent on one another because they no longer make all the goods they need. The end result of exchange is more plentiful goods at cheaper prices for all parties and improved international relations. Over the past several hundred years, we have slowly built up an international marketplace where all players are heavily dependent on one another. The US will not fight with another major power, not because she couldn\\u2019t defeat them, but because the economic losses would far outweigh the gains. As discussed by Pinker, countries that depend more on each other for trade are less likely to have a violent conflict controlling for other factors. In summary, the financial incentives have switched from war to trade for most nations. The Leviathon and gentle commerce actually work together \\u2014 a strong government is able to create markets that allow for safe exchanges and enforce laws regulating trade. In other words, once you have a strong state, trading is easier, and more trading between nations means they are less likely to attack one another. As trade between world powers has increased, conflicts between major powers has also decreased to 0 since 1953. There are doubtless other factors that have played a role in the decline of war between nations. We discussed external historical factors behind the decrease, but Pinker and others (John Horgan in The End of War) have also outlined internal factors, like The Better Angels of Our Nature : empathy, self-control, morals, reason. By examining the data and the reasons, it\\u2019s clear that the major powers no longer see war as a feasible choice. This is not necessarily because they are ethical, but because the economics of war no longer makes sense. At the end of the day, humans \\u2014 and nations \\u2014 are driven by incentives, and through international trade, we have built a world where the incentives favor peace. In a narrow point of view, Pinker is correct: rates of violent conflict have substantially decreased and there is reason to believe they are at the lowest point in human history (if only because data is limited). Also, at least among modern democracies, violence is no longer seen as the default option for solving problems as it has been for almost all of human history. That being said, it\\u2019s worth thinking about how Pinker\\u2019s argument made be misleading. The first point is that by focusing on rates rather than numbers, we are neglecting the actual human suffering. More people dying from war is more people dying from war even if the percentage is decreasing. The numbers can be used to support multiple conclusions depending on one\\u2019s argument. A second central issue is, especially for pre-historic societies, reliable data is hard to get. Most of the numbers for conflict rates and deaths in prehistoric societies come by examining archaeological sites and looking at artifacts for evidence of violent death. However, it could be possible these marks have been misinterpreted and anthropologists could not possibly have studied all prehistoric societies. Simple extrapolation what has been found is the only option, but it\\u2019s also important to not draw immature conclusions. The last major issue we\\u2019ll cover here (for more see Taleb\\u2019s article) is that we could be living in an anomalous age. Pinker calls the most recent 70 years of peace (no wars between modern nations), \\u201cThe Long Peace\\u201d, but it could be really only the temporary peace. Furthermore, as pointed out by Taleb, wars tend to be power law distributed, that is, they have long tails skewed to the right. The vast majority of deaths in armed conflicts are caused by a small number of the conflicts as can be seen below: One single conflict can completely outweigh all others in terms of deaths. Most of the armed conflicts since 1945 have fallen on the low end of the scale, but it only takes a single major battle to overshadow the peace since 1945. It\\u2019s possible a new conflict, one caused by global warming, resource shortages, or territorial disputes, could entirely undo the millennia of progress humans have made on violence reduction efforts. Initially, after reading Pinker\\u2019s book, I was convinced by his thesis. However, after taking the time to dig through the facts myself, a more nuanced picture emerged, one where sensationalist conflicts on both sides are not warranted. I see reasons for optimism: decreasing rates of deaths in armed conflicts mean a human alive today is less likely to die in battle than in recorded history, no battles between major powers since 1953, and a reduction in overall battle deaths since the 1950s, as well as reasons for pessimism: democracy and international trade, so important for reducing major conflicts, appear to be on a decline in recent years. Moreover, while major powers no longer fight directly with each other, they are involved through proxy wars. The exploration of violent conflict highlights the objective of the Reality Project. It\\u2019s not designed to be a feel-good effort but a fact-based endeavor, and, thus, any time I encounter an argument that is appealing to me this should only tell me to be more skeptical. The Reality Project has allegiances to no single interest, except getting at the actual statistics behind our world. It\\u2019s nice when the facts make us optimistic, but even when they don\\u2019t, it\\u2019s critical to understand the data so we can work to improve things. As always, I welcome feedback and constructive criticism.
